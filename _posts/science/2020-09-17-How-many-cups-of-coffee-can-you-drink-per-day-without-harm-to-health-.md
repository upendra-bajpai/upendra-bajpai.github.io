Experts from the University of South Australia took up the study of this issue. To do this, they conducted a study in which more than 347,000 people, aged 37 to 73, took part. Its results were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. It turned out that the risk of developing diseases of the cardiovascular system increases by 22% in people who drink more than 6 cups of coffee a day. According to scientists, most coffee lovers make themselves one or two cups of this drink a day. Moderate consumption of coffee, on the contrary, has a positive effect on the body.

Earlier, doctors called the drink to remove excess sugar from the body.
