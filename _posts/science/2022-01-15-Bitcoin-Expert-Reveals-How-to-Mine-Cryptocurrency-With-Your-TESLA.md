Tesla owners can apparently earn up to $800 per month in crypto by using their cars to mine Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based currencies, at least according to one expert.

Tesla Model 3 owner and Bitcoin miner Siraj Raval recently appeared on Fox Business’ Varney & Co. to explain how his Tesla can mine crypto with his simple tips.

Using an Apple M1 laptop equipped with the namesake chip, Raval plugs into the Tesla’s cigarette lighter outlet, connects to the on-board Wi-Fi, and accesses Honeyminer to start making crypto cash.

“And then it’s just mining. There you go,” he said. “Nothing else necessary… You can run it 24 hours a day, and if you plug your car in in your garage, it’s always powered. It’s a really simple way to do it.”

Raval added that he doesn’t know of any other Tesla owners who have managed to mine crypto with their cars.

However CNBC reports that YouTuber K-Man, aka Chris Allessi, has transformed his Tesla Model S into a crypto mining machine by plugging a Bitmain Antminer S9 rig into the car’s battery via a power inverter.

As an employee at Polygon—the No. 13 cryptocurrency in the world—the idea came naturally to Raval.

“So, I get paid in crypto, all my funds are in crypto,” he said, adding that Polygon’s goal is to scale Ethereum so it may be widely adopted.

“I don’t believe in the U.S. dollar. I mostly just have cryptocurrency, and I think we’re going to get to a very hyperinflated state soon, so I’m just all-in on crypto in every way.”
