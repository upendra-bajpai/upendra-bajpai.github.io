As per the tipster, Apple Watch SE is also likely to come in two size variants. It is also expected to be available in both LTE and Bluetooth versions. The Verge report reveals that since Apple Watch Series 3 is priced at $199, Apple Watch SE is likely to be priced less than that.

Apple iPad Air 4 expected specifications

Going by leaked iPad Air 4 user manual images on Twitter, iPad Air 4 is likely to feature thin bezels and rounded edges. It is expected to come with a Touch ID that will be placed under the side-mounted button. It further suggests that it might house a single camera and a pin connector at the back. According to GSMArena, this pin connector will apparently make it compatible with the iPad Pro range accessories. The images also suggest that iPad Air 4 is likely to come with iPad Pro's gesture-based navigation system.

The tipster Evan Blass has revealed that it will be powered by an A14 chipset and might feature a USB-C port as well.

Apple One Subscription
