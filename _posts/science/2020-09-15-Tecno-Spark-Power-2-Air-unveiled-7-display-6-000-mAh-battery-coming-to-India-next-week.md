The Tecno Spark Power 2 launched in India in late June, a INR 10,000 phone with a massive 7.0” display and an equally massive 6,000 mAh battery. But if you want a slightly more affordable option with most of the same specs, then the new Spark Power 2 Air may be for you.

The sizable 7.0” display covers more than 90% of the front of the device. The resolution is on the low side, 720p+, but that will work just fine with Netflix’s HD plan (INR 350/month). The phone packs stereo speakers to enhance the viewing experience to boot.

The 6,000 mAh battery should last 15 hours of video playback according to official numbers. Or 13 hours of playing a game, if you prefer. There’s no word on charging speed, but Tecno does touts an AI-powered battery care feature.

Above the display is an 8MP camera inside a teardrop notch. It’s paired with a dual LED flash for late night selfies. The back technically houses a quad camera, though only the 13 MP main cam (f/1.8 lens aperture) is of note – it’s joined by 2 MP macro and depth modules, plus an “AI lens”, whatever that is. At least the quad LED promises bright illumination for night time photos.

The Tecno Spark Power 2 Air is equipped with a MediaTek Helio A22 chipset (four A53 cores at 2.0 GHz, PowerVR GE6320 GPU), running Android 10 skinned with HiOS 6.1 (note: full fat Android this time, not Android Go). RAM capacity is 3GB while storage starts at 32GB (it can be expanded with a microSD card).

This is a dual SIM phone, its card slot can accept two nano-SIMs and one microSD (up to 256 GB). Dual LTE and VoLTE are supported, additional connectivity includes Wi-Fi 5 (ac) and Bluetooth 5.0.

The Tecno Spark Power 2 Air will go on sale on September 20 at noon. You will find it on Flipkart, which already has a landing page set up. The price is INR 8,500 ($115) or 15% cheaper than the Power 2. You will be able to choose between Cosmic Shine and Ice Jadeite colors.

Do have a look at the Power 2, though. It’s only slightly pricier than the Air and has the same the screen and battery. However, it offers an octa-core processor, a better GPU and more memory, plus there’s a 5MP ultra wide camera on the back. Here it is on Flipkart.
