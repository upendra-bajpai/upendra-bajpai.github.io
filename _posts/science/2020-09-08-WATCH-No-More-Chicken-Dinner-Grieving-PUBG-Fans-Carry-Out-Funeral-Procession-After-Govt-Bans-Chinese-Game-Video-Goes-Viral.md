At the same time, many took a dig at their plight and even made memes talking about their parents' happiness over this ban. Joining the meme fest, a group of boys has now carried out a funeral procession to bid goodbye to their favourite game.



In a viral video, a group of boys dressed in whites carried a garlanded poster of PUBG on their shoulders and chanted "Winner winner, chicken dinner" in an attempt to morn the ban of the world-famous game.

The app doesn’t show anymore if you happen to search it on the Play Store and App Store. It is in line with the other Chinese apps which were banned by the government earlier.



India has banned altogether 224 Chinese apps so far including popular ones like TikTok, WeChat, and UC Browser which had a huge user base in India.



The first digital strike by India was done in the wake of the June 15 clash in which as many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the Galwan Valley. After several days of standoff, India in June end banned the first 59 apps of China including TikTok and We Chat. A month later India added 47 more Chinese apps to the list.

There is less to cheer about for the gaming community as the government of India recently launched its third digital strike against China by banning another 118 Chinese mobile applications including the viral gaming app Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG).PUBG has a vast fanbase in the south Asian region, including India and Pakistan, and is one of the most loved games of current times. The mobile-based game now has more than 600 million downloads and 50 million active players globally, not including the Chinese mainland where a rebranded version of the game is called 'Game for Peace'.The action to ban the apps came after the fresh Chinese incursion attempts in Indian territory at Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh.
