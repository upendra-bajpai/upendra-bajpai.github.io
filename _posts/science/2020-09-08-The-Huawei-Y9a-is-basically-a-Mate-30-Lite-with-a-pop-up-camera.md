Huawei’s latest phone features a pop-up selfie camera and a 6.63-inch LCD display with 92% screen-to-body ratio.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Huawei plans to sell the phone in many places outside the Middle East and Central and Pacific Asia.

Back when images of the Mate 30 series first started making their way online, it seemed like Huawei planned to release a Lite variant of the phone. Huawei never ended up announcing that device, but the company just revealed what is effectively a Mate 30 Lite by another name. The only problem is you’ll have trouble getting ahold of the Huawei Y9a if you live outside of the handful of markets where the company plans to sell the device. So far, we’ve only seen that it’s coming to Iraq where it will cost $239.

Limited availability aside, the Y9a looks like it could be a decent mid-range option. The phone features a MediaTek Helio G80 processor and a 6.63-inch LCD display with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. The highlight of the Y9a is a 16MP pop-up selfie camera that helps give the phone a 92% screen-to-body ratio. For all other photos, there’s a 64MP primary camera complimented by a 2MP depth sensor and 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro cameras.

In Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and some countries in Central Asia, the company will sell a model of the Y9a that features 8GB of RAM, a 4,200mAh battery, and 40W fast charging support. Outside of those markets, the Y9a will feature 6GB of RAM and a 4,300mAh with 22.5W charging support. According to Huawei, the 40W adapter can charge the Y9a to 70% battery in approximately 30 minutes. Both variants will feature 128GB of expandable storage with Huawei’s EMUI 10.1 coming preinstalled on the phone.

Like most of Huawei’s recent phones, the Y9a won’t come with Google Play, forcing those who buy the phone to get their apps from Huawei’s AppGallery store.

Rounding out the Y9a feature list is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At launch, Huawei plans to sell the phone in three colors: Space Silver, Sakura Pink, and Midnight Black. If Huawei decides to release the Y9a in more markets, we’ll let you know.
