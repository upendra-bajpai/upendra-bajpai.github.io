At this point we're one week away from the grand unveiling of LG's next experiment in the smartphone space, the Wing. This device has been leaking quite a lot recently, and today from Korea comes a new video, this time showing its swiveling display in motion, being rotated and whatnot. See for yourself:

The T shape is definitely unconventional, as is this handset's entire form factor. In a sea of similar looking glass slabs (and some foldable screen devices), this design is definitely fresh. What remains to be seen is how many people are going to be willing to pay around $1,000 for the Wing, especially considering it's been rumored to forego a flagship chipset.

The use cases this form factor enables are intriguing, but we're left wondering how many third party apps are ever going to fully support the unique dual display solution at work here.

On the plus side, the phone doesn't look like it's horribly thick in this video, so there's that. Stay tuned for more leaks on the Wing as they appear, and hang around for the official announcement next Monday.
