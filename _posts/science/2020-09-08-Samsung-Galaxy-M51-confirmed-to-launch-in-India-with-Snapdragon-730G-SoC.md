Samsung Galaxy M51 specifications have been listed on Amazon ahead of its September 10th India launch. Though the smartphone has gone official previously in Germany, the company never explicitly revealed the chipset powering the device. Samsung has now revealed that the Galaxy M51 will launch in India powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G, keeping true to past rumours. The company will announce the Samsung Galaxy M51 price and the first sale date during the launch event.

Samsung Galaxy M51 specifications include a 6.7-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED+ Infinity-O display with a centered hole-punch cutout. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 730G chipset paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The Galaxy M51 features a quad camera setup that includes a 64MP primary camera, a 12MP wide-angle lens, a 5MP macro lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. At the front, the phone gets a 32MP selfie camera.

The USP of the Samsung Galaxy M51 is the massive 7,000mAh battery which promises to deliver up to 64 hours of talk time, 32 hours of video playtime, and 182 hours of music playback on a single charge. The phone supports 25W fast charging and runs on Android 10-based One UI 2.0 out of the box.

Samsung Galaxy M51 price in Germany is 360 Euro (approx Rs 31,400). In India, however, we expect the phone to cost somewhere around Rs 25,000 so as to take on the OnePlus Nord which starts at Rs 24,999.
