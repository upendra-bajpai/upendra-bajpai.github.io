Key Highlights WhatsApp has submitted a new update through the Google Play Beta programme The new sticker pack is currently only limited to beta testers Besides animated sticker, WhatsApp is also working on Wallpaper Dimming

WhatsApp is reportedly working on a new animated sticker pack called Usagyuuun for its Android users. These stickers were spotted by Wabetainfo in WhatsApp 2.20.200.6 beta for Android app, and are currently only limited to beta testers. They are created by Quan Inc and are 3.5MB in size.

These stickers feature a white cartoon character showing different emotions like happy, anxiety, love, and more, and are described as “A little bit peppy, a little bit bizarre.”

Besides this new sticker app, the Facebook-owned WhatsApp is simultaneously also working on a Wallpaper Dimming feature that will allow you to change the opacity of the wallpaper. This functionality will be added to the new Wallpaper section and appear at the bottom of the screen. When you swipe the toggle left or right, it will let you change the opacity of the wallpaper according to your preferences.

Both the animated stickers and Wallapaper Dimming features are currently under development right now and might be available for everyone in the coming days.
