I"ú	<p>Google Search Console is affected by an issue thatâ€™s causing delays in updating the Index Coverage report.</p>

<p>This was confirmed by Google on Twitter at 5:11 am EST on September 14.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re currently experiencing longer than usual delays in the Search Console Index Coverage report. This only affects reporting, not crawling, indexing, or ranking of websites. Weâ€™ll update here once this issue is resolved. Thanks for your patience! â€” Google Webmasters (@googlewmc) September 14, 2020</p>

<p>The Index Coverage report in Search Console shows which pages on a site have been indexed, as well as any problems encountered with indexing.</p>

<p>Note that this issue does not affect Googleâ€™s ability to crawl, index, or rank web pages.</p>

<p>This particular issue only impacts reporting.</p>

<p>That means recently published pages may be omitted from the Index Coverage report even though they are, in fact, indexed.</p>

<p>Until the problem is fixed, the best way to check if a page is indexed is to use the â€œsite:â€ operator in Google Search.</p>

<p>For example, if you recently published a page on video conferencing tips, you would search for it like this:</p>

<p>Video conference tips site:your-domain.com</p>

<p>If Google can find it with the â€˜site:â€™ operator then your content is being indexed just fine.</p>

<p>Still, it would certainly be more convenient if the Index Coverage report was working as designed.</p>

<p>When Will This Be Fixed?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s difficult to say when this problem will be resolved. Even Google hasnâ€™t been able to provide an accurate estimation.</p>

<p>If you look at your Index Coverage report right now youâ€™ll see it was last updated on August 31.</p>

<p>Googleâ€™s John Mueller acknowledged the issue on September 9, saying the report should be caught up â€œsoon.â€</p>

<p>It looks like theyâ€™re a bit behind, but I heard they should be catching up soon again. Sorry for the delay! â€” ğŸŒ John ğŸŒ (@JohnMu) September 9, 2020</p>

<p>Here we are 5 days later and still no sign of the issue being fixed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a delay like this is not unheard of. Search Console reporting has been delayed several times in the past, with issues lasting from days to weeks.</p>

<p>In all cases, Google tweeted updates as reporting was up to date.</p>

<p>So the only thing site owners can do is remain patient and continue to wait.</p>

<p>This article will be updated when Google confirms a fix has been implemented.</p>
