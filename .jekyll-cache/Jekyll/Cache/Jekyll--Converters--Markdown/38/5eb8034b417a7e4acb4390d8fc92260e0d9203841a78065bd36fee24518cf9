<p>In the course of the Earth 4 billion years of history, Including todayâ€™s continents, things have moved quite a bit.</p>

<p>Online interactive maps show you exactly where your hometown roamed along the way. Continental migration for hundreds of millions of years.</p>

<p>Created in a web application by California paleontologist Ian Webster, this map is based on a geological model created by Christopher Stoese. CNN report.</p>

<p>This allows the user to â€œgo back in timeâ€ in preset increments, such as when the first vertebrates appeared or the first green algae.</p>

<p>You can try the map yourself. Ancient earth.</p>

<p>Users can rotate the globe to see what all continents look like and get a quick guide to what creatures were alive on Earth at that time (if any).</p>

<p>In the case of the Middle Triassic, for example, 220 million years ago, â€œEarth is recovering from the Permian-Triassic extinction. Little dinosaurs begin to appear. Together with the first flying vertebrates, Terra feeds and Acosaurus appear.â€</p>

<p>London, for example, sits on an unrecognizable continent and enormous land before it was separated into the island we recognize today.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s part of the natural cycle, scientists say, as tectonic plates gather together into supercontinents and then break again.</p>

<p>Finally, a supercontinent known as Pangea was formed about 310 million years ago and dismantled about 180 million years ago.</p>

<p>In an interview this week, Webster told CNN, â€œIt shows that our environment is dynamic and can change.</p>

<p>â€œEarthâ€™s history is longer than we can think of, and plate tectonics and the current arrangement of continents are a coincidence of time. In the future, it will be very different and the Earth will last longer than all of us.</p>

<p>â€œMy softwareâ€™geocodesâ€™ the userâ€™s location and then runs the location backwards in time using (Scoteseâ€™s) model.</p>

<p>The story continues</p>

<p>â€œWe built our own interactive globe visualization and geocoding and GPates integration so people could connect to their location.â€</p>

<p>Scientists believe that in about 250 million years another supercontinent will form.</p>

<p>Future continents can take many forms: Novopangea, Pangea Ultima, Aurica and Amasia.</p>

<p>In one scenario, the United States and Antarctica may collide to form oneâ€™supercontinentâ€™ with other continents on Earth.</p>
