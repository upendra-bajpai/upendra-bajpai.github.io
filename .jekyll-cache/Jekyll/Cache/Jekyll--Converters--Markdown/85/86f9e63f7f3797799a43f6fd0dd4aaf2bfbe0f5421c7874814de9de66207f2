I"ı	<p>July brought us the best close-up photos of the sun that the world has ever seen. Now, there are some new ones.</p>

<p>In a new photo release from the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, we get up-close views of the sunâ€™s surface, which looks like an elaborate network of fiery land masses that are in fact solar magnetic fields shown at a very high resolution.</p>

<p>Another photo shows us what a sunspot, which appears as a darker speck on the surface of the sun, looks like up close. Mashableâ€™s weekend team firmly noted that this image exudes major â€œbutthole vibes.â€</p>

<p>Apologies to the entire science community, but hey, itâ€™s true.</p>

<p>The images come from Europeâ€™s largest solar telescope, GREGOR. Theyâ€™re some of the first to surface following a major upgrade project that the telescope went through.</p>

<p>â€œThis was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality.â€ project lead Dr. Lucia Kleint said in the press release.</p>

<p>The team apparently saw a major breakthrough in March 2020 when the global pandemic left them â€œstrandedâ€ at the observatory. They used that time to â€œset up the optical laboratory from the ground upâ€ but werenâ€™t able to grab images of the sun due to winter snow storms.</p>

<p>â€œWhen Spain reopened in July,â€ the release continued, â€œthe team immediately flew back and obtained the highest resolution images of the Sun ever taken by a European telescope.â€</p>

<p>The images released in July, meanwhile, came from the Solar Orbiter. That one, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency, launched the telescope-equipped satellite into space on Feb. 9. The photos we saw in July come from its first â€œcloseâ€ pass by the sun, at roughly 77 million kilometers from the star.</p>

<p>GREGORâ€™s images, meanwhile, were captured here on Earth by a very high-powered telescope. The level of detail evident in the images is incredibly impressive, but so too is the upgrading of the telescope itself. Especially in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>â€œThe project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success,â€ Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, said in a statement. â€œNow we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun.â€</p>
