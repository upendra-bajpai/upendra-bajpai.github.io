I"·<p>Soon We Might Get to See Mars in 8K</p>

<p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and broadcaster NHK are teaming up to develop a space camera capable of filming in 4K and 8K resolutions to capture Mars like itâ€™s never been seen before. Meanwhile, 8K video remains prohibitively expensive back down here on Earth, so if youâ€™re going to get some ridiculously high-resolution footage, it might as well be something out of this world.</p>

<p>In a press release announcing the collaboration this week, JAXA said this â€œSuper Hi-Vision Cameraâ€ will film the red planet and its moons, Phobos and Deimos, during the agencyâ€™s planned Martian Moons eXploration mission. Once installed on the MMX spacecraft, it will snap pictures of Mars at regular intervals and partially transmit them to Earth to â€œcreate a smooth imageâ€ and store the originals in a return capsule headed back home.</p>

<p>In addition to filming Mars, the camera would also help JAXA and NHK visualise the spacecraftâ€™s behaviour back down on Earth by combining flight data with its ultra-high-resolution pictures. It could also help them operate the spacecraft, JAXA added.</p>

<p>â€œBy filming MMXâ€™s mission in the Martian system, 300 million kilometers away from Earth, with the newly developed Super Hi-Vision Camera, JAXA and NHK will work together to convey the appeal of a new horizon that has never been seen in detail before, to many people in a vivid and inspiring way,â€ JAXA said.</p>

<p>MMX is scheduled to launch in 2024 and reach Mars by 2025, so itâ€™ll be a while yet before we get to see that 8K footage. With images that detailed, though, it could help scientists unravel the enigma of Marsâ€™ history and provide a closer look at how microbes and water endure on the planetâ€™s surface. And, of course, NHK will walk away from the deal with literally one-of-a-kind footage that no other broadcaster can hope to match. Now thatâ€™s what you call a win-win situation.</p>
