I"ê<p>The moons of Mars are not quite like our Earthâ€™s Moon. Phobos, the larger of the two, is much closer to its planet; compared to the Moonâ€™s 27-day orbit, Phobos swings around Mars in line with the planetâ€™s equator thrice every Martian day (sol).</p>

<p>Solar eclipses, therefore, are much more frequent than those here on Earth. Phobos passes in front of - but never entirely covers - the Sun for an annular or partial eclipse somewhere on Mars most sols. Because Phobos is moving so fast, it never transits for more than 30 seconds.</p>

<p>But, even during this brief time, the Mars InSight lander has recorded something peculiar happening.</p>

<p>To the surprise of Mars scientists, during Phobos eclipses, the landerâ€™s seismometer - the instrument that records ground motions to monitor possible quake activity - tilts, just an infinitesimal little bit, towards one side.</p>

<p>Researchers at ETH Zurichâ€™s Institute of Geophysics were actually studying data from Mars InSight to see if some of the effects of eclipses here on Earth also occur on Mars.</p>

<p>Specifically: â€œWhen Earth experiences a solar eclipse, instruments can detect a decline in temperature and rapid gusts of wind, as the atmosphere cools in one particular place and air rushes away from that spot,â€ explained seismologist Simon StÃ¤hler of ETH Zurich.</p>

<p>InSight is equipped with temperature and wind sensors - but these recorded no change in the atmosphere during Phobos transits. Atmospheric turbulence, atmospheric temperature, and barometric pressure remained pretty much consistent with a normal sol.</p>

<p>The solar cells did, however, register the transits. Actually, it would be very curious if they didnâ€™t, since Phobos can block as much as 40 percent of the Sunâ€™s light - so it was reassuring that something went according to plan.</p>

<p>â€œWhen Phobos is in front of the Sun, less sunlight reaches the solar cells, and these in turn produce less electricity,â€ StÃ¤hler said. â€œThe decline in light exposure caused by Phobosâ€™s shadow can be measured.â€</p>

<p>But that was the extent of the â€œexpectedâ€. Because both the magnetometer and the seismometer chimed in with odd readings - the seismometer with its unexpected tilt.</p>

<p>Actually, the oddity with the magnetometer - used to monitor the magnetic field on the Martian surface - was pretty easy to figure out. Two components showed a decrease very similar to the decrease in the current from the solar array. So the scientists deduced that the decreased current was likely the cause.</p>

<p>â€œBut we didnâ€™t expect this seismometer reading; itâ€™s an unusual signal,â€ StÃ¤hler said. â€œImagine a 5-â€‹franc coin; now, push two silver atoms under one edge. Thatâ€™s the incline weâ€™re talking about: 10^-8.â€</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t seem to be a false positive; the signal is recorded for three transits, faint but real. The team expected that it might be a seismic response to the moonâ€™s tidal - that is, gravitational - pull as it passed overhead.</p>

<p>However, when they compared it to other readings of seismic activity from Mars, the signal bore no similarity to previous seismic activity.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the tether connecting the seismometer to the lander contracted. However, this would have produced a tilt in the opposite direction to what was observed.</p>

<p>And a change in atmospheric temperature could have introduced a density change that nudged the seismometer, but, as we have already discussed, no such change was detected.</p>

<p>But there was one more signal. An infrared radiometer recorded a slight drop in surface temperature during the longest transit, followed by a period of about a minute and a half while the ground warmed back up to its pre-transit temperature.</p>

<p>This, the team believes, is the most likely cause of the strange reading.</p>

<p>â€œDuring an eclipse, the ground cools,â€ said seismologist Martin van Driel of ETH Zurich. â€œIt deforms unevenly, which tilts the instrument.â€</p>

<p>A similar effect was observed in 1997, at the Black Forest Observatory in Germany.</p>

<p>A technician forgot to turn off the light when leaving the seismometer vault, resulting in elevated noise in long-period data as the warmth from the bulb expanded the granite on which the seismometer rested.</p>

<p>A series of experiments with artificial heat sources ensued, demonstrating that seismometers react almost instantaneously to heat changes in the seismic pillar.</p>

<p>The team repeated their own version of this experiment, and found that they were able to obtain a signal consistent with the tilting of InSightâ€™s seismometer.</p>

<p>This information could be used to better understand Phobos and Mars, the researchers said.</p>

<p>For one, InSightâ€™s location is very accurately mapped. Knowing when a Phobos eclipse begins and ends at that location could help scientists more accurately constrain its orbit.</p>

<p>And that, in turn, could help us understand whatâ€™s in store for Phobosâ€™ future.</p>

<p>The moonâ€™s orbit is decaying at a rate of 1.8 centimetres per year, slowing as it goes; eventually, scientists predict, it will grow so close to Mars that tidal forces will tear Phobos apart, turning it into a ring of debris circling Mars.</p>

<p>If the slowdown can be characterised, that can tell us how elastic and warm the planetâ€™s interior is - or how inelastic and cool. And that, in turn, can shed some light on Marsâ€™ formation history.</p>

<p>The research has been published in Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
