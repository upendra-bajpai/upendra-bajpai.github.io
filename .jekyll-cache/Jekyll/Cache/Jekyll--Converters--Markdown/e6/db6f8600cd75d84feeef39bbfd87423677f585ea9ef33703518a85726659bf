I"Ù<p>The planet is around ten times bigger than its shrunken parent star, known as WD 1856+534.</p>

<p>Astronomers have discovered a planet the size of Jupiter closely orbiting the smouldering remains of a dead star, the first time that an intact exoplanet has been discovered travelling around a white dwarf, according to research published Wednesday.</p>

<p>Researchers said the fate of this giant planet, called WD 1586 b, offers a potential vision of our own Solar System when the Sun eventually ages into a white dwarf in around five billion years.</p>

<p>When it has burned through its stores of hydrogen, a star like the Sun enters its death-throes, first swelling enormously into an incandescent red giant that scorches and engulfs nearby planets.</p>

<p>Then it collapses, reducing it to its burnt-out core.</p>

<p>This is the white dwarf, an extremely dense stellar ember glowing faintly with leftover thermal energy and slowly fading over billions of years.</p>

<p>Previous research has suggested some white dwarfs can retain more distant remnants of their planetary systems.</p>

<p>But until now no intact planets had been detected in orbit around one of the dead stars.</p>

<p>â€œThe discovery came as something of a surprise,â€ said Andrew Vanderburg, assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who led the research published in Nature.</p>

<p>â€œA previous example of a similar system, where an object was seen to pass in front of a white dwarf, showed only a debris field from a disintegrating asteroid.â€</p>

<p>The planet is around ten times bigger than its shrunken parent star, known as WD 1856+534.</p>

<p>It was detected sweeping past the white dwarf every 1.4 days using NASAâ€™s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).</p>

<p>Siyi Xu, an assistant astronomer at the US National Science Foundationâ€™s Gemini Observatory, said that because there was no discernible debris from the planet around the star, researchers concluded it was intact.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ve had indirect evidence that planets exist around white dwarfs and itâ€™s amazing to finally find a planet like this,â€ said Xu, in a statement from NSFâ€™s NOIRLab.</p>

<p>The discovery suggests that planets can end up in or near the white dwarfâ€™s habitable zone, and potentially be hospitable to life even after their star has died, the statement said.</p>

<p>â€˜Tantalisingâ€™</p>

<p>What remains a mystery however is how the planet got so close to the white dwarf.</p>

<p>It is thought that the red giant phase makes it unlikely that nearby planets will survive â€“ when the same process happens to our Sun, Venus and Mercury would be expected to be engulfed and possibly the Earth as well.</p>

<p>â€œOur discovery suggests that WD 1856b must have originally orbited far away from the star, and then somehow journeyed inwards after the star became a white dwarf,â€ said Vanderburg.</p>

<p>â€œNow that we know that planets can survive the journey without being broken up by the white dwarfâ€™s gravity, we can look for other, smaller planets.â€</p>

<p>After simulating various scenarios, the authors suggest that WD 1586b might have been thrown into a close orbit due to interactions with other planets.</p>

<p>In an independent commentary on the discovery, Steven Parsons of Sheffield University, said the discovery â€œoffers the tantalizing prospect of detecting additional planets in this system in the futureâ€.</p>

<p>Current estimates are that around one-third of all Sun-like stars host planetary systems, while the Milky Way contains around ten billion of these stars, he said.</p>

<p>The white dwarf WD 1856+534 is just 82 light years from Earth, so Parsons said gravitational effects of other planets on the white dwarf would potentially be detectable by space observatory missions.</p>

<p>â€œThis system therefore opens up an entirely new field of exoplanetary research,â€ he added.</p>
