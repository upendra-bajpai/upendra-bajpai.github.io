<p>â€œIntroduction to Astronomyâ€ Four Instructors: Faherty is also a Senior Scientist and Senior Education Manager at the American Museum of Natural History. Astronomer Michelle Thaler, who is also assistant director of scientific communications at NASAâ€™s Goddard Space Flight Center; Hakeem Oluseyi, an astrophysicist who is also an educator and science communicator; And space biologist David Greenspoon, who is also a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute.</p>

<p>Outlier.orgâ€™s â€œIntro to Astronomyâ€ online course is â€œthe same basic thing you can get with an entry-level college course after completing a one-on-one course,â€ Faherty told Space.com. Faherty added that all four instructors with PhDs and teaching experience were able to access the course using an incredible resource tool belt.</p>

<p>Each of the four instructors has their own strategies, resources, and visuals that they provide for their curriculum, but Faherty was able to share a little about her approach. And, if you enjoy amazing visuals AMNH Planetarium Show , You will like Fahertyâ€™s educational format.</p>

<p>In her course section, Faherty used â€œopen source, open space data or programs we use inside the planetarium,â€ and using these visuals to â€œtake students aboard a spaceship and fly around the data as I describe it.â€ â€</p>

<p>Faherty aims for students to â€œlook around visually using the three-dimensional dataset we have and a lot of data,â€ she said.</p>

<p>Instead of saying, â€œHereâ€™s an image of a planetary nebula,â€ Faherty says, â€œHereâ€™s a three-dimensional distribution of the planetary nebula. Hereâ€™s where you can look across the sky. Now you can see where in the galaxy it is. Now you can see where they are apart from each other.â€</p>

<p>This course is suitable for adults of all ages, from high school students to with a passion for astronomy. You can take classes apart from the basic knowledge of â€œif you have a love for astronomy and a desire to know more about the universe. You donâ€™t need a lot of background knowledge.â€</p>
