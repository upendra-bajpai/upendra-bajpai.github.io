<p>These bizarre never-seen-before sea creatures were discovered below the ice in Antarctica by baffled researchers.</p>

<p>The alien-like organisms are uncovered in a documentary The Secrets of Antarctica which has been shared on YouTube to document their journey.</p>

<p>The on-going mission has seen an international team using state-of-the-art technology to scan the seabed, reports the Daily Star.</p>

<p>Dr Dave Bowden recounts his astonishment over the weird life forms with strange characteristics.</p>

<p>Among the finds were sea lilies called crinoids which had only been seen before in fossil records.</p>

<p>The scientist also explained how he found a sea spider which grows very large legs and has a tiny body.</p>

<p>Other bizarre finds are sponges, which have have no nervous or digestive systems, and feed by filtering water through their pores.</p>

<p>He said: â€œThe reason is the Antarctic continental shelf has been isolated from the rest of the planet for many, many years.</p>

<p>â€œThis is a sea spider, which is one of the groups which is intriguing in the Antarctica group system because theyâ€™re much more diverse than the rest of the world, they grow very large.</p>

<p>â€œThere is a tendency in some groups to lean towards gigantism, itâ€™s basically all legs, thereâ€™s essentially no body, itâ€™s unlike anything we know about.â€</p>

<p>He added: â€œHereâ€™s an example of another magnificent beast, itâ€™s a polychaete worm, youâ€™ll find them under a rock, but this is much, much larger [than normal].</p>

<p>â€œThereâ€™s debate over whether the Antarctic is the reason why these things are larger, or if there are just lineages of this animal that have evolved in the Antarctic and donâ€™t exist anywhere else.</p>

<p>â€œBut one of my most fascinating finds from the voyage was on a seamount north of the Ross Sea, where we found an extraordinary assembly of sea lilies â€“ crinoids â€“ which are closely related to sea urchins.</p>

<p>â€œThe main difference is that itâ€™s anchored in one position.</p>

<p>â€œThe only place weâ€™ve actually seen these before is in the fossil records, weâ€™ve never seen anything like this before alive on the seabed.â€</p>
