<p>Washington D.C. [USA], September 16 (ANI): Acidic fluids â€” which once flowed on the Martian surface â€” may have destroyed biological evidence hidden within Marsâ€™ iron-rich clays, according to researchers at Cornell University and at Spainâ€™s Centro de Astrobiologia.</p>

<p>The researchers conducted simulations involving clay and amino acids to draw conclusions regarding the likely degradation of biological material on Mars.</p>

<p>Their paper, â€˜Constraining the Preservation of Organic Compounds in Mars Analog Nontronites After Exposure to Acid and Alkaline Fluids,â€™ was published on September 15 in Nature Scientific Reports.</p>

<p>Alberto G. Fairen, a visiting scientist in the Department of Astronomy in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell, is a corresponding author.</p>

<p>NASAâ€™s Perseverance rover which launched on July 30, will land at Marsâ€™ Jezero Crater next February; the European Space Agencyâ€™s Rosalind Franklin rover will launch in late 2022.</p>

<p>The Perseverance mission will collect Martian soil samples and send them to Earth by the 2030s. The Rosalind Franklin rover will drill into the Martian surface, collect soil samples and analyze them in situ.</p>

<p>In the search for life on Mars, the red planetâ€™s clay surface soils are a preferred collection target since the clay protects the molecular organic material inside. However, the past presence of acid on the surface may have compromised the clayâ€™s ability to protect evidence of previous life.</p>

<p>â€œWe know that acidic fluids have flowed on the surface of Mars in the past, altering the clays and its capacity to protect organics,â€ Fairen said.</p>

<p>He said the internal structure of clay is organized into layers, where the evidence of biological life â€” such as lipids, nucleic acids, peptides and other biopolymers â€” can become trapped and well preserved.</p>

<p>In the laboratory, the researchers simulated Martian surface conditions by aiming to preserve an amino acid called glycine in clay, which had been previously exposed to acidic fluids.</p>

<p>â€œWe used glycine because it could rapidly degrade under the planetâ€™s environmental conditions. Itâ€™s perfect informer to tell us what was going on inside our experiments,â€ he said.</p>

<p>After a long exposure to Mars-like ultraviolet radiation, the experiments showed photodegradation of the glycine molecules embedded in the clay. Exposure to acidic fluids erases the interlayer space, turning it into a gel-like silica.</p>

<p>â€œWhen clays are exposed to acidic fluids, the layers collapse and the organic matter canâ€™t be preserved. They are destroyed. Our results in this paper explain why searching for organic compounds on Mars is so sorely difficult,â€ Fairen said. (ANI)</p>
