    "body": "2022/01/15 - Alkesh Shah – analyst at Bank of America – predicted Solana could continue to steal some of Ethereum’s market share as it’s easy to use and has significantly lower transaction fees. The strategist further asserted that Solana could become “the Visa” of the cryptocurrency industry. High Hopes for Solana Solana has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrency projects in the past 12 months. Its native token has increased its USD value by nearly 4,300% in one year and is currently sitting as the fifth-largest digital asset with a market capitalization of roughly $50 billion. Despite this significant advancement, the protocol could reach new heights soon, Alkesh Shah from Bank of America opined. He argued that Solana is superior to some of its rivals as it offers low transaction costs and enhanced scalability relative. Moreover, it utilizes both proof-of-stake and proof-of-history technology, granting it further advantages. Thanks to its differentiated design, Solana could take market share away from Ethereum, Shah said. It is worth noting that the latter is still functioning under the proof-of-work mechanism. Ethereum transactions per second are also considerably slower than Solana’s. “These innovations allow for the processing of an industry-leading ~65,000 transactions per second with average transaction fees of $0. 00025 while remaining relatively decentralized and secure,” Shah said regarding Solana’s speed. Subsequently, the analyst made the bold prediction that the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency project could one day serve as “the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem. ” ADVERTISEMENT He explained this could occur because the protocol successfully facilitates micropayments. It also plays a vital role in the gaming and non-fungible token universe. Solana Could Be The Next Bitcoin The Founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX – Sam Bankman-Fried – is also a keen proponent of the blockchain project. Not long ago, he said Solana had “a real shot” at becoming the next most dominant digital asset project because of its speed of scaling. Another advantage that Solana has is the fact that it is green-focused. According to a recent report, it is actually less harmful to the environment than the web browsing giant Google. The statement estimated that two Google searches consume more energy than one transaction on the Solana network. It does not end there. A single transaction on Solana consumes 24 times less energy than charging a mobile phone. In fact, the project’s network uses around 3,186,000 kWh per year, which is equivalent to the average electricity usage of 986 households in the USA. "

    "title": "Currency central: The future of money",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - The conclusion of the experiment was more than satisfactory. A report detailing the findings co-authored by SAMA and CBUAE and released recently said, “The project confirmed that DLT can provide central banks the ability to reimagine both domestic and cross-border payment systems in new ways,” and then added, “We are pleased by the promising results, insights, and learnings described in this report and trust that they will benefit the central banking community and broader financial ecosystem in visualising the potential of this new technology to transform the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) financial markets and indeed our industry. ” In the process, both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, renewed the spotlight on a new trend sweeping the global financial sector and at the same time contributed to the learning quotient on CBDCs. They are part of a growing list of 90 countries engaged in various stages of rolling out the CBDC — which is nothing but virtual money backed by a country’s central bank. These include Sweden, South Korea and Cambodia who have launched pilots and countries like Brazil, China, the United States and India who have signalled their intent. Together, they are creating the quotient of experiences to ready for the launch a CBDC. However, first off the blocks was the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, which rolled out its pilot in April last year and, then, in early December 2021 they extended it to two more islands, Dominica and Montserrat. DCash, the name of their CBDC, was launched in the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia. Other central banks are keen, but are yet take the plunge. The question, then, is why is there a sudden surge in interest among central banks all over the world about a CBDC? The obvious logic from the outside looking in is the growing popularity of decentralised currencies like a crypto currency. The USP of crypto currencies in offering frictionless transactions — particularly those involving cross-border transactions like remittances and simultaneously solving for trust (the sine qua non of any central bank currency) through the use of a transparent mechanism like blockchain — is offering an alternative currency. In short, private currencies are poised to compete with fiat currencies. This is something that could potentially upend the world of finance. Presumably central banks would prefer to be part of the solution, in ensuring frictionless payments at low or no costs to consumers by tapping the same tech — and thereby stay ahead of potential competition. All the more since banning a crypto currency in a new world order where money in the form of code does not recognise geography is hardly an option. Addressing a recent webinar hosted by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy on the CBDC, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar very candidly admitted as much. “It is not clear what specific need is met by these private VCs (virtual currencies) that official money cannot meet as efficiently, but that may in itself not come in the way of their adoption. If these VCs gain recognition, national currencies with limited convertibility are likely to come under threat,” he said. The Blockchain Logic It is important to keep in mind that the one aspect that is common to both CBDC and cryptocurrency is the underlying technology: blockchain. In short, blockchain is the driver of this disruption, and cryptocurrency is just an example of its application. The technology can be used for a host of services, including the delivering of social benefits like pensions, poverty-relief packages and unemployment benefits. Among other things, it will eliminate leakages due to corruption. The geeky definition, sourced from IBM, is: “It (blockchain) is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). ” The key terms are shared, ledger and asset. Essentially, the technology enables the inter-linking of a secure computer network to transact business where every entity who is part of it has equal knowledge about every leg of the transaction. Exactly why it is also often referred to as decentralised computing — DeFi or decentralised finance — is nothing but a blockchain application in finance. This is a utopian world in which everyone knows what is going on. Information is power, not by withholding it but by sharing it with every stakeholder. So, at one level, it becomes that much more difficult to pull off scams without the cover of anonymity. What this very obviously does is reduce traditional risks associated with a business transaction and, of course, usher in the cost efficiencies. And unlike in a centralised system, there is no single point vulnerability in the architecture. At the same time, it is prone to cyber-attacks. Nonetheless scores of crypto currencies have started to emerge. From less than ten a few years ago, a guesstimate pegs them at just under 8,000 at present. They are applying blockchain benefits, efficiency and accuracy to the business of information — the one factor influencing competitiveness. As IBM succinctly explains the benefits: “The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. ” Keeping the definition of blockchain based on a shared digital network mentioned earlier, a cryptocurrency is a digital currency created by a private entity — who issues a token, which then becomes the currency; Facebook, for instance, is calling its token Diem. Think of the time when private currencies existed, before they were replaced by sovereign currencies. Exactly the reason why cryptocurrency is seen as a threat to central bank currencies world over. Especially ‘stablecoin’ — one of the popular crypto currencies — which mimics an official currency as its value is pegged to a reserve asset which can either be the US dollar or gold: thereby it is less susceptible to volatility, something that is the norm with most of the tokens in circulation. Unlike in the case of a cryptocurrency, a CBDC is based on a private blockchain network and is essentially like an Intranet. In effect, it will be like creating a PDF version of a print magazine: the form is different but will not do anything more than a fiat currency which is physical. A cryptocurrency, on the other hand, employs a public blockchain network, which allows for decentralised computing — something that is very similar to the worldwide Internet architecture. As David Wessel, senior fellow and director, The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, Brookings Institution, pointed out during a recent webinar, a cryptocurrency combines network theory (which promotes efficiency), gain theory (creates incentives through issue of tokens like bitcoins for all the participants in the transaction) and cryptography (which ensures security). It is these foundations that are posing a threat to fiat currencies issued by central banks, which is exactly why they are moving quickly to plug the efficiency gap faced by central currencies, especially with cross-border transactions entailing exports and imports. Any trade financed by a CBDC will be settled in real time as it is a fiat and won’t need to go through the rigour of inter-bank settlements. This was also established by Project Aber initiated jointly by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Tipping Point in Global Finance The subtext of this seeming faceoff between crypto currencies and the CBDC is as Eswar Prasad, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution, explained in his just released book The Future of Money, a tipping point in global finance. “The era of cash is drawing to an end and that of Central Bank digital currencies has begun. Money, banking, and finance are on the verge of transformation. Physical money is becoming a relic. The digital payment system is becoming the norm around the world. Banking is going to change as other forms of financial intermediation gain prominence. Much of the world’s population will gain access to at least basic financial services, improving lines and economic forecasts,” he writes. Interestingly, several countries in the developing world are already pushing the envelope, especially in enabling financial inclusion and real-time payments. In fact, several of them are ahead of the developed countries like the United States in FinTech innovation. While M-Pesa in Kenya enables a mobiles-based money transfer, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) from India and the most recent launch of PIX, the real-time payments from Brazil, offer similar and efficient solutions. All of them are also forcing a shift in consumer behaviour, the death of the leather wallet as it were. India’s UPI, for example, is capable of solving any denomination payment (including for one rupee) and a large volume of transactions. At the moment, UPI’s use is growing exponentially and averaging about 2-3 billion transactions a month — but this transactional efficiency can be scaled, if required, to 2 billion a day. In fact, in value terms, UPI was just shy of logging a record $1 trillion worth of transactions in 2021. The proposed digital rupee to be issued by the RBI can instantly leverage the growing UPI platform to reach 200 million users — a difficult target for any country to match. This could popularise the use of CBDC and enable the Reserve Bank of India reach critical mass in quick time. Addressing the seminar hosted by Brookings, Prasad framed this competition between the CBDC and crypto currencies favourably. Something where the two systems may actually complement each other and creating a win-win for all. “What is important in my view is really a new era of competition that could ultimately benefit both consumers and businesses, but it’s going to be in the form of digital payments of various sorts. And this is going to be good not just for consumers and businesses within economies, but cross-border payments where there are a lot of frictions that affect, say, economic migrants sending any money back home, exporters and importers. All of these barriers are going to become much less significant impediments to the flow of finance. ” Anil Padmanabhan is a journalist based in New Delhi "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Global inflation continues to weigh on the minds of investors, which is why having diversified exposure to alternative assets is a must in order to fend off inflation. One alternative is bitcoin, which has had a roller coaster ride over the past few months. After reaching an all-time high in November 2021, the leading cryptocurrency has fallen below $50,000 after seeing upwards of $69,000. Nonetheless, it can still serve as an inflationary hedge given its bullish 2021. If bitcoin can see a return to form towards the upside, it can serve a purpose in any portfolio, particularly if the goal is to mitigate inflation risk. “Like commodities, used as a complementary investment to a portfolio of stocks and bonds,” a ProShares market outlook for 2022 notes. “Particularly because of its fixed supply, bitcoin is also often viewed as a hedge against inflationary pressures. ” “Barriers to invest in the asset class have previously been high and included the use of unregulated exchanges or wallets,” the outlook adds further, noting in a chart below that it has vastly outperformed stocks and bonds. “However, recent innovations—including bitcoin-linked ETFs—have made exposure to bitcoin more attainable for the average investor. Bitcoin is volatile and relatively uncorrelated with traditional asset classes, so a modest allocation may go a long way. ” Accessible Bitcoin Exposure Sans the Volatility While Bitcoin has become less volatile over the years as its popularity as an investment vehicle grows, investing directly in the cryptocurrency still isn’t for the weak at heart. That’s where the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) comes into play. As the ProShares market outlook mentions, ETFs linked to the leading cryptocurrency can make the digital currency more accessible to investors. Furthermore, investing directly in the digital asset on a public exchange opens potential hacking risks, as the ProShares outlook also notes. Therefore, as opposed to directly investing in the cryptocurrency itself, another way to get alternate exposure to bitcoin is to play its future price increases. As such, ETF investors may want to play on this bullish notion with Proshares’ BITO. Investors who can’t stomach the volatility that’s hit bitcoin as of late but still want alternative asset exposure to the leading cryptocurrency may want to give the fund a closer look. Additionally, bitcoin’s price of just over $40,000 (as of January 14) may not fit everyone’s budget, but BITO can provide alternate exposure at a lower price of entry.

    "title": "Money: back to the future",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - The continuing process of digitalisation of the world’s financial system as well as the move away from cash during the pandemic are raising existential questions about the future of money. Newsletter from 14 January 2022 I write this newsletter from Belfast, where the DeLorean sports car – most famous for having been used as Marty McFly’s time machine in the Back to the Future movies – was manufactured. I invite you to join me in a DeLorean time machine as we travel back and forth across decades to see what money was like in the recent past and what it may be like in the near future. 2000 Let’s go back to 2000. I taught my very first lecture at Queen’s University Belfast that year. The topic was money and the debate in class focused on the possibility and merits of a futuristic cashless society. That year more than three-quarters of total payments were made in cash. Other payments were made using cheques, direct debits and credit cards. The arrival of the ATM (automated teller machine) in 1967 had revolutionised banking and payments by making cash much easier to access. According to LINK, there were about 31,500 ATMs scattered across the UK in 2000, which was a 75% increase from one decade earlier. 2010 When we fast-forward to 2010, two major things had changed in the realm of money as highlighted in my Economics Observatory article on the lessons from history for digital currency. First, chip-and-pin and contactless payment cards had been introduced in 2003 and 2007 respectively. Despite these innovations, cash was still being used in 65% of payments in 2010 and the number of ATMs had doubled since 2000 to just over 63,000. Second, Bitcoin – the world’s first cryptocurrency – had been introduced to the world several months after (and partly as a response to) the global financial crisis of 2007-09. In his Observatory article on Bitcoin and other digital currencies, William Quinn (Queen’s University Belfast) provides a good introduction to the cryptocurrency and explains its advantages and disadvantages compared with traditional currencies. He suggests that the advantages of Bitcoin are few (if any), while the disadvantages include its costliness as a medium of exchange and its poor store-of-value property, which arises from its very high volatility, as Figure 1 shows. Figure 1: Price of Bitcoin (US dollars), December 2016 to January 2022 Source: Blockchain. com 2020 The next stop in our time machine takes us back to 2020. In this world, we see how the innovations of the previous decade have transformed money. To begin with, cash use has shrivelled to a mere 17% of all payments and the number of ATMs in the UK has fallen sharply from a high of 70,588 in 2015 to 54,574. This trend was well under way before Covid-19, but as the Observatory article by Bernardo Bátiz-Lazo (Northumbria University) and Manual Bautista-González (Columbia University) illustrates, the pandemic has accelerated the move towards a cashless society. The pandemic has also seen increased interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with over 4,000 different cryptocurrencies now in circulation. Meme cryptocurrencies, such as Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, became very popular with the general public during 2020 and into 2021. In his Observatory article on Dogecoin, Andrew Urquhart (University of Reading) describes how this meme cryptocurrency works and explains how it became one of the world’s largest. In terms of market value, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are the 12th and 14th largest cryptocurrencies, with market values of $21. 7 billion and $16. 5 billion respectively. The pandemic has also witnessed increased speculation in cryptocurrencies as retail investors have poured their savings into all things crypto. This has resulted in very steep rises in the prices of cryptocurrencies. Figure 2 shows the appreciation in price between the start of 2020 and the end of 2021 of the three largest cryptocurrencies, as well as the two largest meme cryptocurrencies. Figure 2: Appreciation in the prices of leading cryptocurrencies between the start of 2020 and the end of 2021 Source: Coinmarketcap. com Note: The appreciation in Shiba Inu is from 2 August 2020; the scale is logarithmic. As well as rising dramatically over the past two years, cryptocurrency prices have also been very volatile, as illustrated by the price of Bitcoin in Figure 1. In his Observatory article, William Quinn explores the main drivers of changes in the price of Bitcoin, suggesting that the price is largely determined by three things: First, large holders, known as ‘whales’, who have the ability to manipulate the market and move the price of Bitcoin. Second, news coverage and discussion of cryptocurrencies on social media brings in new naïve investors who buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which in turn drives up prices. Third, the number of Tether stablecoins that have been issued. Although the price of Bitcoin is usually reported in dollars, Tether is the main currency for buying Bitcoin. It is an on- and off-ramp for Bitcoin investors, in other words, a vehicle for helping investors convert fiat currencies into Bitcoin and vice versa. Stablecoins, such as Tether or USD Coin, have grown in popularity from the beginning of 2020. The market capitalisation of Tether, for example, has grown from $4. 11 billion at the start of 2020 to $78. 43 billion at the end of 2021. The volatility of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has undermined any claim that they are money or have money-like properties. Stablecoins, on the other hand, have a stable value because they are convertible one-for-one into US dollars or a basket of currencies. As I point out in my Observatory article, this makes most stablecoins akin to bank money. But the difference is that banks are regulated, and their deposits are underwritten by insurance and government guarantees. 2030 If the flux capacitor in our DeLorean has enough power to get us to 2030, what might we see when we go to the shops and cafes and walk down the high street? ATMs are much less common. Cash is used for a small number of purchases and mainly by the poor and old. Government policy has attempted to slow down the march towards the cashless society and to ensure that citizens are not excluded from the digital payments system. Cash is still the back-up means of payment for many because global pressures and geopolitical forces mean more frequent electricity, telecoms networks and internet outages, as well as cyber-attacks. We would be unsurprised to see in 2030 that the cryptocurrency bubble and craze is long over and forms a new chapter in the second edition of our book Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles. Nevertheless, some of the underlying crypto technology is being used for decentralised finance applications and smart contracts. Stablecoins, where they still exist, are regulated by the authorities and have been subsumed into the traditional banking system. The main digital currency is one provided by central banks, like the Bank of England, in the form of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The report on 13 January 2022 by the House of Lord’s Economic Affairs Committee, which argued that CBDC was a solution in search of a problem, has been long forgotten. Andrew Urquhart, in his Observatory article on CDBCs, argues that their development is inevitable, and in my article, I argue that the chief lesson from history is that currency issue is eventually concentrated in the hands of government or their central banks. The economic debate around the globe in 2030 is focused on the issues of privacy and exclusion because CBDCs are being used in some countries to control the citizenry and exclude minorities and dissidents from the formal economy. Maybe we should have listened to the House of Lords back in 2022 when they raised concerns about privacy. Before we leave 2030, I will buy a souvenir with some Britcoins (the colloquial name for the Bank of England’s CBDC) to take back to 2022 – a celebratory book telling the story of how Northern Ireland beat England on penalties in the final of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.

The government web shutdowns during an explosion of unrest in the country, the world’s second-largest centre for mining, caused bitcoin’s global computing power to drop around 13% as data centres used to produce the cryptocurrency were knocked offline. read more Alan Dorjiyev of the National Association of Blockchain and Data Center Industry in Kazakhstan, which represents 80% of legal mining companies in the country, said most crypto producers were now back online. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters. com Register Yet the resumption of operations may belie problems to come for the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry, according to four major miners interviewed by Reuters, with some saying they or their clients may look for other countries to operate in. The internet outage compounded growing concerns about the stability and prospects of the business as tighter government oversight looms, the miners said. Vincent Liu, a miner who moved operations to Kazakhstan from China to take advantage of the country’s cheap power, said the changing environment had led him to look at shifting operations to North America or Russia. “Two or three years earlier, we called Kazakhstan a paradise of the mining industry because of the stable political environment and stable electricity,” said Liu. “We are evaluating the situation … I suppose we will keep a part of hashrate in Kazakhstan and will move some to other countries,” he said. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are “mined” by powerful computers that compete against others hooked up to a global network to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The process guzzles electricity and is often powered by fossil fuels. Kazakhstan became the world’s No. 2 centre for bitcoin mining after the United States last year, attracting an influx of miners and data centre bookings from former global leader China after a crackdown on the industry by Beijing. read more In August, Kazakhstan accounted for 18% of the global “hashrate” - crypto jargon for the amount of computing power being used by computers connected to the bitcoin network. That was up from 8% in April, before Chinese miners shifted machines and bought capacity at Kazakh data centres. POWER PLAYS Kazakhstan’s crypto mining farms are mostly powered by aging coal plants, which are a headache for authorities as they seek to decarbonise the economy. Power-hungry miners have forced the former Soviet state to import electricity and ration domestic supplies. The government is now looking at how to tax and regulate the largely underground and foreign-owned industry. It said last year it planned to crack down on unregistered “grey” miners who it estimates might be consuming twice as much power as the “white” or officially registered ones. read more Din-mukhammed Matkenov, co-founder of crypto miner BTC KZ, said an influx of Chinese miners had worsened problems for domestic miners by gobbling up power. Clients may look to move to the United States and Russia, he said. “We think that the development and stability of mining industry in Kazakhstan is in danger,” said Matkenov, whose firm has three data centres in Ekibastuz, a city in northern Kazakhstan, running over 30,000 mining rigs. Patchy power supply has complicated the company’s business, he added. “It is very unstable and really hard to predict the profits to pay the electricity bill and salaries. At the moment we are close to being bankrupt and clients are trying to find other countries where they can relocate to with a more stable governmental ruling. ” Kazakhstan’s energy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Still, Kazakhstan’s relatively low taxes, labour costs and equipment still offer advantages, the four miners said. Power costs a minimum of $0. 03-$0. 04 per kilowatt, Matkenov said, similar to the United States and lower than $0. 05 in Russia. “There is an ease of doing business in Kazakhstan that allows well-capitalised projects to deploy much faster than would be possible in the West,” said Mike Cohen of Canada-based miner Pow. re. “Those willing to establish operations in the region have a greater tolerance for geopolitical risk and are not put off by fossil fuel-based energy sources. ” Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters. com Register Reporting by Tom Wilson in London; Additional reporting by Tamara Vaal in Nur-Sultan; Editing by Pravin Char Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

    "title": "A new era for the crypto age",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - In January 2009, as the world was reeling from a financial meltdown of near unfathomable proportions, a new currency was born. A decentralised digital currency for the post-crisis age, bitcoin promised an alternative to the mainstream financial system for those who found themselves suddenly suspicious of the traditional banking institutions of decades past. From its earliest days of trading, bitcoin had its fervent supporters. While some dismissed it as an underground fad, others believed that bitcoin was truly the future of money, and imagined a utopia where crypto replaced cash. These voices have only grown stronger over the course of the last decade, as bitcoin has enjoyed a meteoric rise, moving rapidly from the financial margins into the mainstream. Now a $2trn industry (see Fig 1), cryptocurrency is no longer an underground phenomenon. In September of this year, El Salvador made history by becoming the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. On the other side of the Atlantic, Ukraine is said to be hot on its heels, with plans to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, according to reports. For early proponents of bitcoin, this feels like a landmark moment, confirming what they always believed to be true: that the future of currency is crypto. However, while bitcoin has its supporters, it is not without its sceptics. Many economists view cryptocurrencies with suspicion, with regulators in both Europe and the US issuing warnings on the dangers of trading with crypto. Its highly volatile nature means that El Salvador’s bitcoin experiment is something of a gamble – and we are yet to see whether it will pay off. But with one country paving the way with crypto, others may soon follow suit. For better or for worse, El Salvador could be the start of a digital currency domino effect. Brave new world Big problems often require radical solutions. El Salvador has long been plagued with a number of very particular economic woes: a small, central American country of just 6. 5 million citizens, the nation’s economy is heavily reliant on remittances – money sent home from the two million Salvadorans who are currently living and working abroad. With expatriated Salvadorans sending more than $4bn back to their home country every year, remittances make up one fifth of El Salvador’s total GDP. Within El Salvador itself, meanwhile, two-thirds of citizens work within the informal economy, and 70 percent do not have bank accounts. A desire to tackle this unique set of economic circumstances seems to have driven El Salvador’s decision to embrace cryptocurrency. President Nayib Bukele – who at the age of 40 is often described as Latin America’s first millennial President – has championed crypto as a path to both financial inclusion and independence for Salvadoran citizens. It is his hope that the move could save Salvadorans up to $400m a year in transaction costs on remittances, while giving access to financial services to those who are currently unbanked. “In El Salvador, we are trying to start the design of a country for the future,” Bukele said in a video message broadcast to the Bitcoin 2021 conference in June of this year, where he first announced his plans to formally adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender. “In the short term, this will generate jobs and help to provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy. In the medium and long term, we hope that this decision can help us push humanity at least a tiny bit into the right direction. ” Legal tender Following the announcement of Bukele’s crypto-vision for El Salvador in June, a bitcoin bill was passed, requiring all Salvadorian businesses to accept payment in bitcoin as well as the US dollar – the nation’s existing legal tender – effective from September 7. To mark the launch of the nation’s new bitcoin era, all Salvadoran citizens were gifted a digital wallet called Chivo (Spanish slang for ‘cool’), with $30 of credit pre-loaded for each user to spend. While this may all sound very promising, the reality proved to be rather more challenging than perhaps anticipated. The country’s landmark bitcoin adoption day was beset by technical difficulties – the Chivo digital wallet was forced offline for hours after government servers were overwhelmed by an influx of sign-ups, and President Bukele took to social media to complain that app stores on Apple and Huawei devices were not yet hosting the government-backed app. Elsewhere, it was reported that ATMs were running out of money, as citizens rushed to convert their $30 bitcoin holdings into cash. In the capital city, more than 1,000 people took to the streets in protest of the bitcoin adoption, setting off fireworks and burning a tyre in front of the Supreme Court building in an impassioned display of opposition to the law change. “Like all innovations, El Salvador’s bitcoin process has a learning curve,” Bukele said in a tweet, reflecting on the rollout. “Not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month. ” While there may have indeed been noble intentions behind El Salvador’s bitcoin experiment, it’s clear that creating a crypto-utopia is going to be a very hard task for tech-savvy Bukele to pull off. Opinion polls show that the overwhelming majority of Salvadorans remain unsure as to how bitcoin actually works, while the currency’s extreme volatility is yet another source of anxiety for many. At a time when pandemic-related economic uncertainty remains rife, it is understandable that bitcoin feels like too large of a gamble for some sceptics. And yet, despite the many teething troubles that El Salvador has encountered, it looks like a number of other countries are now looking to follow in its digital footsteps. The path to financial freedom? El Salvador is one of a growing number of developing economies that have been gravitating towards cryptocurrencies. In Mexico, Cuba and Venezuela crypto transactions are fast becoming a part of daily life, allowing for fast, cheap and reliable cross-border transactions in countries that also rely heavily on remittances. Just one day after El Salvador officially adopted bitcoin as legal tender, Panama introduced a draft bill that aims to recognise bitcoin as an alternative payment method – suggesting that the cryptocurrency domino effect may already be underway. The phenomenon isn’t unique to Latin America, either. In developing economies across the globe, crypto appears to be gaining mainstream appeal. Each year, leading blockchain data company Chainanalysis publishes its Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, listing the world’s top 20 countries for crypto adoption (see Fig 2). In the 2021 ranking, 19 of the 20 countries listed are emerging and frontier markets, reflecting a surge in usage in developing markets. From South-East Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa, cryptocurrencies are gaining a significant foothold – and are quietly filling gaps in the market that traditional financial services were never able to penetrate. It should perhaps be unsurprising that crypto has enjoyed such success in the developing world. After all, many developing countries were also early adopters of mobile payments, with citizens both urban and rural leapfrogging traditional financial products and moving straight into the world of remote, cashless payments. The best-known success story is Kenya’s M-Pesa, a mobile-money platform that has recently hit 50 million users across Africa, and that has been credited with expanding financial inclusion across the continent by enabling payments and transfers among the traditionally unbanked. While it goes without saying that cryptocurrency is an entirely different world to that of mobile payments, the early success of such technologies may have paved the way for the digital currencies of today. Developing nations As is the case with El Salvador, crypto’s potential to enable cheap cross-border transactions is central to its appeal in developing nations around the world. Migrant remittances are a significant source of income for low- and middle-income countries, totalling approximately $554bn worldwide at the end of 2019, according to the International Organisation for Migration. That said, sending money back home can be a slow, complex and above all, costly exercise for many migrants living abroad. The UN estimates that currency conversions and fees on international transfers eat up approximately seven percent of the total amount sent through remittances every year – a considerable percentage of what is a crucial source of income for some of the world’s most economically vulnerable people. The Salvadoran government is currently exploring options to mine bitcoin using geothermal power In areas of instability, conflict or hyperinflation, meanwhile, crypto is proving to be something of a safety net to many. In Afghanistan, cash all but dried up following the Taliban takeover in September, forcing banks to close and seeing citizens struggle to purchase food and other basic necessities. A freezing of foreign aid has aggravated the unfolding humanitarian crisis in the country, while money transfer services MoneyGram and Western Union temporarily halted services in Afghanistan in the weeks following the US military’s withdrawal – cutting off many Afghans from a critical source of income in a desperate time of need. For those seeking an urgent solution to the nation’s cash crisis, crypto has offered a much-needed lifeline, with the conflict-ridden country seeing a surge in cryptocurrency usage among its citizens in 2021. Indeed, in Chainanalysis’ Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, Afghanistan now ranks seventh in the world for peer-to-peer crypto transactions. Last year, however, it didn’t even appear on the list. In a similar vein, Libya, Palestine and Syria are all near the top in global online searches for bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency, while downloads of bitcoin wallet BlueWallet grew by 1,781 percent in Lebanon in 2020, as the country continues to grapple with an ongoing financial meltdown. In times of conflict and crisis, it would seem crypto offers a way to circumvent broken systems and to provide some financial protection to those in real need. No safe bet Cryptocurrency is far from being the perfect cure to the world’s many financial ills. It has, undoubtedly, been a useful – and at times, necessary – tool for some of the world’s most vulnerable citizens. But it is not without its flaws. In more developed economies, there remains a more sceptical outlook on crypto, both among economists and the wider population alike. Indeed, in the US and Europe, cryptocurrency payments are far from being an everyday occurrence for most citizens. The world of crypto remains something of a niche subculture, largely dominated by semi-professional traders and blockchain aficionados. There is also a significant gender imbalance among traders, too – in the US, 76 percent of current crypto holders are men. The main criticism of crypto, however, is that it is notoriously volatile in price. Thought to be 10 times more volatile than most major currencies, the market value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin can fluctuate by hundreds of dollars in a single day, making crypto a high-risk investment for many. Regulators have repeatedly warned about the dangers of investing and trading in cryptocurrency, citing this unpredictable and extreme volatility as one of their most pressing concerns. Price fluctuation not only puts people’s personal finances at risk, experts warn, but could potentially threaten financial stability across multiple different markets. In October, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sir John Cunliffe called for urgent cryptocurrency regulation, citing financial stability concerns. In a speech given at Sibos, an annual banking conference, he compared the current crypto boom to the rocketing value of US subprime mortgages before the catastrophic 2008 global financial crash. Without rapid intervention, he argued, a potential crypto crash could plunge the global economy back into another 2008-level crisis. “When something in the financial system is growing very fast, and growing in largely unregulated space, financial stability authorities have to sit up and take notice,” he said. “They have to think very carefully about what could happen and whether they, or other regulatory authorities, need to act. ” In 2021 alone, cryptocurrencies have surged by around 200 percent to an estimated value of $2. 3trn – up from $800bn in 2020. As Cunliffe noted in his speech, subprime mortgages were valued at around $1. 2trn in 2008, and triggered a global financial meltdown of unprecedented proportions when borrowers began defaulting on loans. With the fallout from the 2008 crash still fresh in economists’ minds, it is hardly surprising that regulators are setting alarm bells ringing when it comes to crypto’s seemingly unstoppable growth (see Fig 3). Environmental issues And crypto’s inherently volatile nature isn’t the only cause for concern. There is also growing unease among sceptics and aficionados alike over bitcoin’s environmental impact. Bitcoin mining – the process through which ‘new’ bitcoins are created – is incredibly energy intensive. In order to be awarded a new bitcoin, ‘miners’ must use their computers to solve a series of incredibly complex puzzles. Whoever solves the puzzle first is awarded a new coin to their computer. However, solving the problems requires the use of incredibly powerful specialised computers, which then need to run at full capacity, burning through an extraordinary amount of energy during each mining operation. As a result of this energy intensive process, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates that a single bitcoin transaction has the same carbon footprint as 680,000 Visa transactions. Already, this considerable carbon consumption is beginning to damage bitcoin’s reputation on the global stage. In May, Tesla CEO and long-standing crypto advocate Elon Musk announced that his electric car company would no longer be accepting bitcoin for car purchases, due to pressing concerns over the currency’s environmental impact. “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50 percent) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions,” Musk said in a tweet, clarifying his position. Environmental concerns also played a role in the World Bank’s decision to decline a request from El Salvador to assist with implementing bitcoin as legal tender. The central American nation approached the World Bank earlier this year, seeking technical assistance with its plans to formally adopt bitcoin as an alternative national currency. “While the government did approach us for assistance on bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings,” a World Bank spokesperson told Reuters in July. If crypto continues on its current upwards trajectory, the inconvenient truths surrounding its environmental impact and its inherent volatility will surely become increasingly difficult to ignore. An undefined future Like all modern innovations and technological advances, the world of cryptocurrency is a fast-moving one. In little over a decade, crypto has gone from a niche, abstract idea to a $2trn industry. Bitcoin’s introduction as legal tender in El Salvador marks a pivotal moment in the history of cryptocurrency, but the journey certainly isn’t over yet. In many ways, it feels like this could just be the beginning, as countries around the world look to potentially follow El Salvador’s lead. No matter the outcome of the Salvadoran bitcoin experiment, one thing is for certain – governments across the globe will be watching closely, and taking notes. Less than one month on from the Bitcoin Law coming into effect in El Salvador, more people are said to have a Chivo bitcoin wallet than a traditional bank account. According to President Bukele, three million Salvadorans are now using Chivo – almost half of the country’s total population. By contrast, only a third of Salvadoran citizens are believed to have a bank account. It’s amongst these unbanked citizens that bitcoin is likely to be having the greatest impact. For those with access to a smartphone but not to a bank, payments, deposits and money transfers are now available to them at the touch of a button. While financial inclusion may have previously been a real economic hurdle for El Salvador, now digital literacy is perhaps the most pressing challenge, as the Bitcoin Law means little if citizens don’t fully understand the financial options available to them. In developing economies across the globe, crypto appears to be gaining mainstream appeal Despite the initial glitches and setbacks, El Salvador’s bitcoin gamble has already achieved some undeniably impressive results. As of October, 30 bitcoin ATM machines have been installed in major cities in the US, including Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago, in the hopes that Salvadoran expats will use Chivo to send money back home. The plan appears to be working – in a tweet posted on October 16, President Bukele told his followers: “today, we received 24,076 remittances, adding up to $3,069,761. 05 (in one day). ” When it comes to the environmental aspect of bitcoin, too, the country also appears to be making some progress. Aware of the growing concerns surrounding the cryptocurrency’s carbon footprint, the Salvadoran government is currently exploring options to mine bitcoin using geothermal power. A pilot project has been set up at a geothermal power station near El Salvador’s Tecapa volcano, where 300 state-of-the-art mining computers are currently being powered by electricity generated from the volcano’s high-pressure steam. In El Salvador, where geothermal electricity already accounts for a quarter of domestic energy production, volcano-powered mining could be the solution to bitcoin’s dirty problem. The world watches on It is still far too early in El Salvador’s bitcoin journey to draw any firm conclusions on its success or lack thereof. But it certainly seems likely that the country’s bold experiment will fuel a new flurry of activity in the world of digital currencies. Most of the world’s central banks are already looking to create their own versions of digital currencies, with the Bank of England announcing in April that it is exploring the possibility of launching a new form of digital money to exist alongside cash and bank deposits. According to a report by PwC, 60 governments around the world are currently working on some form of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), with 88 percent of those under construction said to be based on blockchain – the same technology that powers bitcoin. With so many CBDCs being tested, the question is not if they will be introduced, but when. As for whether any countries will be as bold as El Salvador in adopting any form of cryptocurrency as legal tender, that remains to be seen. For now, the future of crypto remains as unpredictable as its market value. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Polkadot Recovery And HUH Token Are Successfully Multi-Chain Polkadot is one of many different cryptocurrencies that are experiencing a recovery period in their market price. This is a welcomed period after such an extensive bearish trend that took over the crypto market towards the end of 2021. HUH Token also shared its exciting news. HUH token is now multichain and its creators are continuing the development of their social media platform that will be released at a later date for the public. This is a space that has not been heavily explored before and could present an opportunity for those who want to hold the token before the social platform launches. Polkadot has its own blockchain and therefore, its native currency is a coin. Polkadot is an interesting concept as it is formed of two different types of blockchain. The main blockchain is known as the relay chain, where permanent transactions take place. The alternative blockchains are created by users and Polkadot refers to them as parachains. The parachains are meant to be adapted for various use cases and then feedback to the main blockchain, the idea being that normal blockchains can be limited in the number of uses they can provide. Whereas Polkadot is bringing a unique concept to the cryptocurrency space. HUH Token was developed primarily with the HUH team’s future vision in mind. That vision includes a social media platform where HUH Token would be a currency within the network. The idea would involve a significant incentive for content creators to move themselves and their audience to the new platform as there would be rewards for the content they make. Creators would be rewarded for the type and amount of engagement on anything that they make, allowing a wide variety of entertainment types to be shared. Despite the social platform being a future endeavour, HUH Token itself also has qualities that are appealing to investors who are considering purchasing a newer token. HUH Token has a referral system that provides Binance Coin to those who successfully refer new buyers. Moreover, HUH Token provides static reflection. This is a small fee applied to trades involving HUH Token. This fee is then redistributed across every HUH Token wallet. One of the latest updates for HUH Token is that they have become a multichain cryptocurrency. Initially, the token was only available on PancakeSwap. Since then, HUH Token has been listed on UniSwap and is therefore available on the Ethereum and Binance Blockchain. This will allow more users to purchase HUH Token or swap using a wider variety of tokens, increasing the token’s trading volume. Future endeavours are an essential factor when considering where to place your money with hopes of a high return. Polkadot is one of the contenders for a new blockchain to challenge for a higher position in the cryptocurrency world. HUH Token is a brand-new token with exciting prospects. It could be worth acquiring it before the token increases in price due to updates on their overarching project.

    "url": "/Crypto-Growth-in-Africa-The-How-and-the-Why/",
    "title": "Crypto Growth in Africa – The How and the Why",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - The cryptocurrency market remains a vast and rapidly growing sector and one that currently boasts a cumulative market capitalisation value of $2. 26 trillion. While the crypto space is largely synonymous with innovation in developed economies, its continued growth has actually been driven by rising demand in developing countries and regions across the globe. Take Africa, for example, where cryptocurrency transactions totalled $105. 6 billion in the year ending June 2021 on the back of soaring peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. But why has Africa become a natural home for cryptocurrency growth in the current marketplace? The Rise and Rise of Cryptocurrency in Africa Incredibly, cryptocurrency adoption in Africa grew by 1200% in the year ending June 2021, with this established as the fastest adoption rate in the world. So, although the continent continues to play catch-up with other regions globally, the rate and pace of growth is truly something to behold at present. In particular, markets such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa have showcased some of the highest grassroots adoptions in the world, with each of these nations ranked in the top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. If we drill down deeper into the numbers, we can see that monthly cryptocurrency transfers to and from Africa of under $10,000 (which are typically made by individuals and small businesses) increased by more than 55% during the year to reach $316 million in June. According to data from Chainalysis, the number of monthly transfers also rose by nearly half during the same period, surpassing the 600,700 record set previously. The vast majority of this activity is taking place in Nigeria, which is home to the region’s largest economy, along with South Africa and Kenya. Why is Africa Blazing a Trail in the Crypto Market? Bitcoin (BTC) is also the market-leading crypto asset in Africa, although it’s interesting to note that the region’s users largely use this token for the purpose of commerce rather than speculation. This is a reversal of the BTC trends observed elsewhere in the developed world, where Bitcoin is largely owned and leveraged by financial traders to speculate and secure considerable returns on investment through platforms such as the webtrader MT4. But why is this the case? Well, the answer also describes the same reason that cryptocurrency is popular in Africa in the first place. More specifically, there’s a large and unbanked population in Africa, with up to 57% of the population (approximately 95 million) lacking access to a traditional bank account and even basic financial services. For these people, cryptocurrency represents a viable and accessible currency rather than an investment asset, and one that can be utilised to buy products, secure services and engage in digital currency transfers. With this in mind, crypto adoption rates are likely to increase further in the months and years ahead, particularly given Africa’s relatively young and tech-savvy population.

One such project that is leading the way in the anime and Inu sector of the cryptocurrency market by adding new and innovative features, as well as classic favorites, to its expanding ecosystem is Kishimoto Inu, a project design to be a medium for the buying, selling and creation of Anime on a blockchain. It is clear that Kishimoto plans to make a foundation in the cryptoverse by serving utility first and locking over $3,000,000. 00 of liquidity for 100 years in addition to being available on four exchanges (XT, ZT, Hotbit, LBank, and BKEX). Following the project’s stealth launch in October of 2021, the Kishimoto Inu team has been hard at work developing the new protocol components that will transform Kishimoto into a standalone DeFi and NFT protocol that can serve the needs of the entire anime ecosystem. The first project to implement an active burn mechanism One of the biggest upcoming developments for the protocol is the release of the Katsumi governance (DAO) token that will give token holders an active say in the future development of the protocol. Story continues In keeping with the promise to innovate and lead the way in the blockchain industry, the Katsumi token will be the first token to implement an active burn mechanism on the Kishimoto token by automatically sending a small percentage of coins that are purchased to a dead wallet, helping to instantly increase the price per coin with each transaction. It has been made clear by the team that 90% of Katsumi token total circulating supply will only be obtainable via staking Kishimoto tokens thus rewarding current Kishimoto holders, encouraging investors to hold for the long run. Katsumi’s tokenomics will assist with Kishimoto’s success while simultaneously helping make the world a better place. 5% of each transaction will be actively burned while another 3% will be donated to charities that are voted on by token holders. This innovative new mechanism is a first for governance tokens and demonstrates the team’s willingness to step outside of the boundaries of what has been done before in order to bring more value to its community. Innovative strategies to revolutionize the cryptoverse Several significant developments in the pipeline for the Kishimoto Inu platform including the release of KishiSwap V2 in Q1 that will allow staking and the ability to mint NFTs, a built-in VPN that can help ensure token holders and investors remain safe and secure while browsing the internet, and a 3D NFT marketplace that will showcase the best that anime on the blockchain has to offer. Kishimoto is also developing a P2E (play to earn) game that will utilize their NFT collection in game. To top it all off, the team at Kishimoto Inu has demonstrated that they are on top of the latest emerging trends in the crypto economy as a whole with the release of a cross-chain bridge that allows token holders to transfer their assets between the Fantom network, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Ethereum. Those looking to get in early on one of the next big trends in cryptocurrencies as the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology continues to unfold in the years ahead would be wise to take a deeper dive into Kishimoto Inu as this future all-in-one anime focused ecosystem has the first-mover advantage when it comes to the combination of anime, DeFi and NFTs.

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Last Updated: January 14, 2022 Looking for the 3070 hashrate? We’ve got it all here. The Nvidia RTX 3070 is a favorite among gamers, and for a good reason too. It packs more horsepower than a 2080Ti, and comes with extra RT cores under the hood to boost performance, which bodes well for its performance when mining cryptocurrencies. With several models of RTX 3070 having already been released, we look at if it brings the hash to earn you some non-fungible cash. What is the hashrate of the RTX 3070? The hashrate for the RTX 3070 is up to 62 MH/s while mining ETH. The hashrate for the RTX 3070 LHR is up to 45 MH/s. This nerf to hashrate is going to be standard for most brand-new RTX 3070 cards, meaning that it’s more likely that you will find the LHR model than the non-LHR model. However, be sure to keep an eye on reseller sites to get your hands on a non-LHR model, which is much more efficient. In addition to this, there are also several other models of 3070 such as the 3070 Ti and 3070 16GB. RTX 3070 hashrate GPU Hashrate Power Consumption RTX 3070 62 MH/s 115W RTX 3070 LHR 45 MH/s 107W Source: Hashrate. no We always base hashrates on Dagger Hashimoto values, mining Ethereum. This is because ETH is one of the most commonly traded cryptocurrencies, meaning that you could potentially make a huge amount of ETH with an RTX 3070. Be sure to correctly tune your miners to maximize the efficiency of your mining set up so you can reach profitability sooner. The 3070 is a fantastic mining card, and that means that everyone wants one, so it can be difficult to acquire. RTX 3070 hashrate: what to expect With a strong hashrate on normal and LHR models, the RTX 3070 can be considered one of the better price to performance options that you have in the current market. Additionally, there should be some consideration taken when it comes to how your configuration is set up. One of the best things to do would be to check out your other options for graphics cards to mine on if this one is a little bit tough to find. We’ve popped the alternatives below. After a new card to build into your system? Look no further. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Executing buy and sell walls are usually done by those with high net worth, better known in the ecosystem as “whales” with large holdings of several assets. This puts other holders in a slightly vulnerable position since they’re at the mercy of large token holders selling a substantial amount to impact the token price. A buy wall elicits the opposite response from a sell wall. The buy wall provides support to the asset’s price instead of suppressing it. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued a warning about a new cryptocurrency scam that involves QR codes. The FTC says scammers are using impersonators to trick people into giving them money in transactions involving QR codes and cryptocurrency ATMs. Scammers have increasingly turned to cryptocurrency in recent years, perhaps because it’s more difficult to track and transferable between currencies. 🆕 #ScamAlert: There’s a new spin on scammers asking people to pay with #cryptocurrency. It involves an impersonator, a QR code &amp; a trip to a store (directed by a scammer on the phone) to send your 💰 to them through a cryptocurrency ATM. Learn more: https://t. co/xZ7uM31ycg — FTC (@FTC) January 10, 2022 Last summer, the Daily Dot reported that the esports powerhouse FaZe Clan was accused of being caught up in a “pump and dump” scheme involving crypto. Earlier this week, CNBC reported that securities regulators say cryptocurrency and other digital asset scams are the biggest threat to investors “by far. ” The FTC says targets of the latest scam may receive a call from someone claiming to be law enforcement, the government, or your utility company. The caller could also pretend to be an online romantic interest or someone saying you’ve won the lottery or another prize. As with any scam, the caller eventually asks you for money. Those who seem amenable will be directed to a store or other business that has a crypto ATM. The scammer will remain on the phone throughout, the FTC says. Once you reach the ATM, the scammer directs you to buy crypto. Then they send you a QR code with their address embedded in it, the FTC reports. You’re instructed to scan the code so that the money transfers to them. “But then your money is gone,” the FTC says. In its warning, the FTC stresses that “no one” from law enforcement, the government, a utility, or a prize committee will ask for payment via cryptocurrency. “If someone does, it’s a scam, every time,” the agency said. If you receive a call, email, text, or social media message—especially from a stranger—asking for advance payment for something via crypto or otherwise, it’s a scam. The FTC asks people to report suspicious activity of this nature at reportfraud. ftc. gov. "

    "title": "Advertise crypto, but be careful and remember tax",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - Last month, the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) upheld complaints on 7 different adverts relating to cryptocurrencies. In each case, the adverts were considered to be socially irresponsible and taking advantage of consumers’ inexperience in dealing with this increasingly popular, yet relatively new, form of digital asset. The ASA is the UK’s independent advertising regulator. Adverts do not go through the ASA for approval before they are published. Instead, the UK’s self-regulatory process requires publishers of non-broadcast adverts, sales promotions, and direct marketing to refer to the rules published in the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct &amp; Promotional Marketing (the “CAP Code”) to check whether their adverts and marketing comply with the regulations. The central principle of the CAP Code is that all marketing communications need to be “legal, decent, honest and truthful”, enshrined in rule 1. 1. This includes the requirement that marketing communications are prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society (Rule 1. 3). Certain sections of the CAP Code are designated to specific types of adverts, with adverts and marketing for financial services regulated in detail in section 14. Rule 14. 1, for example, requires that any offers of financial products be understood easily and do not take advantage of consumers’ “inexperience or credulity. ” All 7 of the adverts in the ASA’s rulings of December breached both rules 1. 3 and 14. 1. Specifically, adverts that emphasised how easy investment in cryptocurrency is (with phrases such as “Register in minutes, deposit instantly, then make super-easy and secure crypto trades”, as used by CoinBurp) were considered irresponsible for giving the overall impression that investment in cryptocurrency was straightforward. 6 of the 7 adverts actively promoted investment in cryptocurrency, and all were also found to be misleading. Misleading advertising is prohibited by section 3 of the CAP Code and the adverts are judged by the impression they create and the likely effect on consumers (rather than the marketer’s intentions). All 6 adverts promoting investment in crypto last month were found misleading and in breach of rule 3. 3, which requires advertisers to give enough information to allow consumers to make informed decisions. For example, the claim “£5 in #Bitcoin in 2010 would be worth over £100,000 in January 2021. Don’t miss out on the next decade” by Coinbase was criticised for implying that crypto’s past performance could be a guide for the future and customers could expect a similar return on investment going forward. The 6 adverts promoting crypto investment also breached rule 14. 4, which requires marketing communications for financial services to make clear that the value of investments is variable and can go down as well as up. The rule was breached because the adverts did not sufficiently emphasise the volatility of crypto. For example, Kraken’s one-second risk warning that cryptocurrency can be highly volatile on a 20-second digital poster was considered insufficient. The ASA was also critical of the adverts for actively promoting crypto investment but not making consumers aware of the tax implications. This may sound surprising because, as noted by eToro (UK) Ltd, tax information is not always required in financial product advertising and there wasn’t a regulatory basis requiring such information when the ads were published. Despite this, the ASA considered that most consumers were unlikely to be aware that capital gains tax would be payable on profits from investing in cryptocurrency, so the ads were deemed to take advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity. The one ruling which did not fall foul of this rule was Papa John’s, which promoted “FREE Bitcoin worth £10 for every pizza bought”. For Papa John’s, it wasn’t the lack of tax advice, but the use of pizza to promote opening a cryptocurrency account that the ASA found “trivialised what was a serious and potentially costly financial decision”. The ASA’s tough approach to cryptocurrency advertising emphasises the need for advertisers to clearly and explicitly illustrate the risk of the investment, or risk an adverse ruling from the ASA. Ultimately, all 7 of these adverts were ordered to be taken down. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Professional athletes request to be paid cryptocurrency Some of the highest paid athletes are being paid in cryptocurrency and several more are requesting to be paid in Bitcoin (BTC). Some crypto companies have even begun offering endorsement deals including digital currency. So what exactly is cryptocurrency and why are athletes and franchises making the switch? What is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is digital money that is based on blockchain technology — Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most well-known currencies but there are over 10,000 being publicly traded. Unlike the U. S dollar, cryptocurrencies have no authority that maintains or manages it’s value. They are purchased using real currency and can be exchanged online for profit similar to stocks or used to purchase goods and services — in this case they are being used to pay athletes. Companies are beginning to sell their own cryptocurrency which are usually known as tokens. Crypto in the sports world In 2020, free agent Russel Okung became the first professional athlete to be paid in Bitcoin. He requested that half of his $13 million salary be converted to crypto. Okung was believed to be the highest paid player in the NFL in 2020 when the value of Bitcoin nearly doubled soon after he received his salary — Okung’s invested $6. 5 million was quickly worth more than his entire salary. Okung was not the first athlete to request portions of his salary in cryptocurrency. However, he was the first successful one. In 2019, NFL quarterback Matt Barkely requested the Bengals pay his contract in BTC. His request was denied due to potential balance sheet issues for the franchise. Several franchises and companies struggled to maintain Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Cryptocurrency is counted as an intangible asset, meaning that its balance may be reduced over time and if its price were to rise it couldn’t be recorded until it’s sold. Due to this inconvenience, franchises are hesitant when players request to convert their salaries and other compensations into cryptocurrency. Recently, rules have changed and the sports world wants to invest in cryptocurrencies. Professional leagues around the United States will soon be using and accepting cryptocurrencies for things like ticket purchases and signing free agents. The Sacramento Kings became the first team to accept bitcoin as a means of exchange in 2014 and have announced that they will allow players, coaches and staff to be paid in bitcoin. . The Dallas Mavericks, who recently partnered with the crypto company Voyager, announced they would begin accepting bitcoin to purchase merchandise and game tickets. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said that he believes once teams start recording bitcoin on their balance sheets then payment options will become more accessible for players. The Oakland Athletics recently hopped on the crypto train too, when they announced they would accept a single bitcoin in exchange for suites the entire season, no matter how much the value fluctuates. . Future of crypto in the sports world Okung made a breakthrough in 2020 and inspired other franchises and players to begin participating in the world of cryptocurrencies. Franchises all over the major leagues have began offering cryptocurrency as compensation for players and staff. BTC has been around for nearly 14 years and has become extremely prominent in the world over the past five years — the future of crypto is unfolding before our eyes in the sports world with major players signing their contracts and receiving cryptocurrency. Saquon Barkley of the New York Giants will receive 100% of his endorsement money in bitcoin, according to Joe Pompliano, host of the Best Business Show. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence of the Jacksonville Jaguars partnered with Blockfolio and will receive a crypto signing bonus. Sean Culkin of the Kansas City Chiefs will receive his entire salary in bitcoin. Athletes and franchises are taking the risk of making a profit or losing money. The future is here in the world of sports and before we know it, all athletes will be using bitcoin or another form of cryptocurrency to receive endorsement money or their salaries. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Baby Doge Coin and EGC- Top Binance Chain Currencies surges in 2022 The Cryptocurrency market has experienced some bullish runs from many cryptocurrencies up to date. Two years ago, bitcoin dominated the cryptocurrency market, gobbling up 75% of total crypto market value. But as crypto has ballooned to exceed $2. 1 trillion in assets, the industry has fragmented. Today, bitcoin’s share sits below 40%, and new crypto networks are popping up every day. Baby Doge Coin and Ever Grow are two currencies that are among the fastest-growing currencies on the Binance Smart chain. These coins attained a history-breaking mass adoption within months after their launch. These cryptocurrencies are worth tracking in as they continue their bullish run in 2022. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) Baby Doge Coin was born on June 1, 2021, with the goal of a purposeful decentralized meme project. It is termed by crypto enthusiasts as a fun meme with a serious mission to spread. Baby Doge set a record of over 250,000+ holders and a market cap of over $500 million+ in just 21 days of its birth. $BABYDOGE is a deflationary token designed to become scarce over time as a 5% tax on each transaction is added to the liquidity pool. Baby Doge holders will get more Baby Doge Coins automatically sent to their wallets simply by holding Baby Doge coins. The number of Baby Dogecoin in their wallets will continue growing as Baby DogeCoin holders will automatically receive 5% for every transaction in the Baby Doge ecosystem. The community gets more Baby Doge Coins through commissions from each transaction. In 2022, Baby Doge Coin Passed the 1. 2 million Token holders mark while surging more than 100%. Baby Doge is one of the fastest-growing and most loved communities in the crypto world. Baby Dogecoin is decentralized and owned by its fun, vibrant community. Community is everything, and Baby Doge strives to include everyone from around the globe. As of today, Baby DogeCoin price is $0. 000000004026 with a 24-hour trading volume of $21,860,444. Its community vouched that $BABYDOGE is in for the long haul. The decentralized community is fostering and adopting long-term development of the Ecosystem and foundation to drive real use cases. Ever Grow (EGC) Ever Grow(EGC), launched in September 2021, has made a buzz in the crypto space due to its unique reward system. According to the contract audit by solidity finance, 8% of each transaction is distributed automatically in BUSD to the holder’s wallet. The crypto recently surpassed the 130K token holder mark and USD 32 million in reward distribution. As the rewards are in BUSD, a regulated stable coin, holders don’t have to pay taxes on their rewards. EGC is designed to become more scarce over time. All holders of EGC earn an 8% reward in a stable coin, BUSD, from every Buy/Sell Transaction. 3% from Every Buy/Sell Transaction is sent to Buy-Back and burn wallet while 2% is transferred into the liquidity pool for Pancakeswap to create a stable price floor.

    "title": "Crypto airdrop season: Why people are making thousands for 'free'",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - NurPhoto/Getty Soul woke up on Christmas Day to a pleasant surprise. It wasn’t an unexpected gift in his Christmas stocking, but rather an unlikely alert on his phone. A new cryptocurrency had launched, and he was eligible to claim some for free. It sounds like a scam, no more sophisticated than an email from an alleged Nigerian prince. But it wasn’t. Soul, a recreational trader in his thirties who didn’t offer his real name, hit “claim,” paid a transaction fee and watched $2,000 worth of tokens flow into his wallet. In the bewildering world of cryptocurrency, this is called an airdrop. They’re not as rare as you may think. Many traditional companies raise funds by going public and offering stocks to the public. Organizations operating on Web3, the blockchain-integrated internet, go a similar route by launching a token that people can buy and sell on exchanges. Some of these token launches are accompanied by airdrops. If you’ve used the tool that the Web3 organization provides, you get a bunch of tokens dropped into your wallet. Imagine if Adobe went public and, to raise awareness, sent 100 stocks to anyone who’d used Photoshop in the last 12 months. “Airdrops can be thought of as customer acquisition costs,” said Alex Gedevani of the Delphi Digital research firm. Their utility is twofold. First, they act as marketing. Nothing captures attention like the prospect of free money. Second, it’s become etiquette that blockchain apps will do an airdrop when they list a token. Punters therefore experiment with new apps with the knowledge that, if the app succeeds, a lucrative airdrop is likely in future. “It gets me super hyped for Web3,” said Soul, who’s been trading as a hobby since 2020. “Airdrops incentivize you to dip your toes into everything. ” The company behind the Christmas Day airdrop is called OpenDAO. Anyone who bought or sold on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace, could claim OpenDAO’s $SOS tokens. As of Jan. 12, some 300,000 wallets have claimed the airdrop. (Unusually for an airdrop, OpenDAO isn’t officially associated with OpenSea. The purpose of OpenDAO is to support traders in ways that OpenSea doesn’t – but that’s a whole other story. ) The more money people had spent on OpenSea, the bigger the airdrop they were eligible to receive. Anyone who claimed the airdrop would see a Spotify Wrapped-style infographic detailing their NFT trading data from 2021. Soul had spent $25,000 on NFTs via OpenSea, which put him in the top 6%. The airdrops received by the top 1% border on the obscene. Crypto whales published their infographic on Twitter, boasting of airdrops worth tens of thousands of dollars. Several traders had bought so many NFTs, and spent so much on ethereum’s notoriously expensive transaction fees, that they were able to claim $140,000 worth of $SOS. Well, 6 months into NFTs 1. 3M spent@The_OpenDAO decided to bless the community for Christmas $sos for the people! #HODL pic. twitter. com/eW4J5nUWvd — David Hunnits (@D_Hunnits) December 25, 2021 Bro…this is insane I can’t believe it, thank you very much @9x9x9eth pic. twitter. com/yQ1gPf3EdI — shamdoo. eth 👽🐐🐧 (@TheShamdoo) December 25, 2021 OpenDAO became the hot new token, with $650 million worth of $SOS being traded on Dec. 26. It now has a market cap of $312 million, has been listed on several major exchanges and is among the biggest DAOs on the market. (DAOs are decentralized autonomous organizations, which work by issuing tokens that double as voting rights – token owners then vote on how the DAO’s treasury is spent. ) If there’s one thing that can be counted on in cryptocurrency, it’s that success is immediately imitated by others. OpenDAO garnered a huge amount of attention, and the airdrops have been flowing ever since. In come the drops Airdrops aren’t anomalies, but they’re usually spread out over a period of months. Before Christmas, the last big one came in November courtesy of Ethereum Name Service, a tool that allows people to change their wallet number to a wallet name, like Daniel. eth. Since Christmas, however, there’s been a flurry of airdrops that have sought to mimic OpenDAO’s success. The first was GasDAO, where traders were dropped tokens based on how much they’d spent on ethereum transaction fees. Soul’s airdrop was worth $1,300. Others got much more. “How I made over $250K in the NFT space in December, an analysis of the unique opportunities in this space,” a prolific trader tweeted. “I claimed $SOS and $GAS. ” On Monday, Jan. 10, Looks Rare followed. It’s an NFT marketplace that hopes to compete with OpenSea, and it issued an airdrop to raise awareness. Anyone who bought or sold an NFT in 2021 is able to claim $LOOKS tokens if they list one NFT on the Looks Rare platform. The lowest tier of airdrop was worth $400, though more active traders received much more. Next, on Thursday, Jan. 13, came fees. wtf, an analytics tool that shows traders how much money they’ve spent on transaction fees. The airdrop is designed to hype an analytics dashboard tool that fees. wtf will soon launch. Yet all airdrops are not created equally. The intended purpose is to get people not to sell their tokens, but to hold them and buy more. Some tokens become more valuable over time, while others fade to obscurity. Looks Rare’s tokens have doubled in value since Monday’s airdrop, while $GAS tokens held their value for a couple days before most airdrops became worthless. “After OpenDAO’s success, many people have copied,” OpenDAO creator 9x9x9 told me. “But they use OpenDAO success to raise money for themselves. ” Was in the tier 1 category and eligible for 10,000 $Looks tokens which is worth 10 eth at the time of this post 😳 and what has Opensea ever done for us?? @LooksRareNFT pic. twitter. com/ejAHzh6jFv — LeBored. eth💎👀 (@LeBoredJames) January 10, 2022 9x9x9, who declined to be named, says airdrops are often used to enrich founders. A team will reserve tokens for themselves, launch an airdrop to create hype and then sell the reserved tokens at a high. He didn’t name the airdrops to which he was referring, but boasts that OpenDao is a passion project and that no tokens were reserved for the team. As is always the case in cryptocurrency, though, there are risks and scams. A flaw in fees. wtf’s smart contract caused the token’s price to collapse in less than an hour, a disaster for early investors. The allure of free tokens is strong, and shady developers can take advantage of this by creating dodgy smart contracts that can drain funds from the wallet that claims the airdrop. “Always question any form of free money received in crypto,” said Delphi’s Gedevani. “Airdrops coming from public-facing teams can be easily identified as legitimate, but there’s been a handful in the past with malicious intent, mostly from unknown sources, that have led to loss of user funds. ” Soul is ambivalent about the risks, and is instead keen to keep the money flowing. “These airdrops have me wanting to buy into every new tool. ” "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Is a new cryptocurrency benefitting the LGBTQ+ community as intended, or is the initiative doomed to fail thanks to an ill-conceived name choice? “Maricoin,” the first cryptocurrency specifically targeted toward LGBTQ+ investors shares a similar name to an anti-gay Spanish pejorative (maricón). The similarity is eliciting mixed reactions. In a story for TheStreet, University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor Lee Badgett said, “LGBTQ+ activists have figured out how to harness the economic power of LGBTQ+ workers and consumers in many other ways using standard government-issued currencies. ” Badgett added, “It’s not obvious to me what this new cryptocurrency adds beyond providing a new opportunity to talk about the importance of economic inclusion for LGBTQ+ people. ” But Badgett, author of “The Economic Case for LGBT Equality: Why Fair and Equal Treatment Benefits Us All,” said that the name isn’t necessarily problematic as the LGBTQ+ community has reclaimed homophobic slurs before. “[That’s] where ‘queer’ and ‘dyke’ came from, for example, and many LGBTQ+ people now use those terms,” he said. But out in SocialMediaLand, opinions vary. One Twitter user, Diogo Pereira, posed the following question: “Can a form of advanced capitalism such as #cryptocurrency actually help [marginalized] communities that are constantly discriminated and oppressed by #capitalism?” he asked. Can a form of advanced capitalism such as #cryptocurrency actually help marginalised communities that are constantly discriminated and oppressed by #capitalism? Looks more like another attempt to bank of #queer money. #maricoin https://t. co/H7mDuoofwN — Diogo Pereira 🏳️‍🌈🌍 (@diogos_p) January 4, 2022 Inarguably, the LGBTQ+ community has buying power. According to a 2018 study by Kantar Consulting and Hornet, it is estimated that the LGBTQ+ community’s buying power in the U. S. is $1 trillion—nearly equal to that of African-American or Hispanic people. Francisco Alvarez, CEO of Miami-based Borderless Capital, which is backing the venture, told Openly that 8,000 people were on a waiting list to buy Maricoins before the currency even started trading. The plan is that the LGBTQ+ cryptocurrency will be accepted at businesses such as restaurants and shops and hotels. To be able to accept Maricoin, the businesses will have to sign an “equality manifesto” defending the right of LGBTQ+ people “and everyone suffering from exclusion. ” “The establishments that accept our coin will be listed on our map, which will work as an LGBTQ+ guide for anyone visiting any city in the world,” Alvarez said. “If they violate any of the points of our anti-discrimination manifesto, for example, if they fire a pregnant woman because of her pregnancy, they will be expelled from Maricoin. ” The benefits to the LGBTQ+ community, said Alvarez, will be global. “We’ll be able to give microcredits for people to set up a small LGBTQ+-friendly cafe in Colombia or to support projects helping queer refugees flee countries where they’d be stoned to death,” he said. “We’re looking forward to changing the world. ” Maricoin co-founder Juan Belmonte told TheStreet. com that the idea for the LGBTQ+ cryptocurrency came up at a Pride party in Madrid last July. “Since we move this economy, why shouldn’t our community profit from it, instead of banks, insurance companies or big corporations that often don’t help LGBTQ+ people?” Belmonte told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Blockchain technology ( Cryptocurrency ) remains one of the hottest topics in the financial services sector and has continued to spread rapidly in the areas of cash and digital identity in recent years. In its short existence, the technology has gone from being an innovation to a mechanism that is actively used by major corporations, governments, and public organizations. This only confirms that in the future, the technology’s potential will unfold even further. Trends and prospects in gambling Analysts predict that by the end of 2023, the growth of the global gambling market could surpass $500 billion. The gambling business is difficult to regulate, and even casino Vulkan, which has obtained licenses, cannot guarantee one hundred percent transparency. Blockchain will solve this problem and help the sphere reach new heights. The key features of the technology are transparency and the highest degree of protection of the data received. Data correction requires a unique code provided and verified by the system. Blockchain-based online casinos or crypto casinos feature strict tracking of all monetary transactions. A distributed system of data storage ensures that the received data is located on multiple devices and cannot be changed. Since the data is publicly available to system participants, it is easy to cross-check, giving users a guarantee of fair gaming. Gambling resources use Blockchain in a variety of ways. For example, they offer slots at https://vulkan. bet/en/category/slots that are based on this technology, or they provide players with the ability to transact in cryptocurrency. Either option is attractive to customers and increases their confidence in the gambling establishment. By using crypto wallets, users can remain completely anonymous. In recent years, the number of crypto casinos that have started accepting digital money as an alternative payment method has increased markedly. Cryptocurrency Features of the Technology The specifics of betting and payout of winnings on blockchain make the entire process of cash circulation in casinos open and remove any doubt from customers about the successful transfer of winnings or whether the funds will reach their destination. For cryptocurrencies, borders between countries and the location of the sender and recipient of the payment do not play the slightest role, which is not the case with traditional payment systems. Another significant advantage is that payments are made directly, without intermediaries, and are therefore significantly accelerated. The use of smart contracts in money transactions will enrich the functionality of gambling institutions and enable all of its users to check existing algorithms. This will get rid of one of the main negative aspects of the gambling industry – gamblers’ distrust of software that is fully managed by right holders, who are able, at the push of a button, to tilt the advantage in their favor. A lot of online gambling establishments operate in this way, and there is no way for gamblers to know if they are honest and trustworthy. The use of crypto-technology is the reason why gambling services have emerged that are not trusted by their customers. Other articles from mtltimes. ca – totimes. ca – otttimes. ca "

    "title": "Is Coinbase a Good Buy for 2022?",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - The capital markets ended 2021 with precipitous sell-offs in high-growth technology stocks. The sell-offs were primarily driven by slowing growth in stay-at-home stocks, investor concerns over inflation, and tax harvesting. Traditional equities are not the only assets experiencing valuation and price compression. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) are both down over 30% since reaching peaks in November 2021. Following its initial public offering in April 2021, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) benefited from market euphoria and the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies in particular. This was short-lived, and the stock has been on a downward spiral, falling over 20% since December 2021. Let’s dig in and see if now is an opportune time to buy Coinbase on the dip. The cryptocurrency sector is crashing Despite the economic and social hardships from the pandemic, meme stocks and cryptocurrency scams have flooded the markets and helped fuel a hyperbolic, unsustainable rise in valuations. This false sense of euphoria seems to be finally bringing a reality check. The final months of 2021 experienced significant sell-offs in high-flying technology stocks in particular. These sell-offs have now mutated beyond stocks, and cryptocurrencies are the next asset to experience valuation compression. After reaching all-time highs in November 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum began the new year in a downward spiral. In the first week of January, Bitcoin experienced its longest continuous price decline since 2018. Moreover, leading cryptocurrencies Ethereum and Solana have also fallen near 20% since the beginning of the year. The financial results for companies such as Coinbase are closely correlated to the prices of cryptocurrencies. For this reason, its business could fluctuate significantly throughout the year, driven by the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. Unlike a company with highly predictable recurring revenue, Coinbase relies on transaction fees from trading. Don’t miss the forest for the trees Investors should keep in mind that Coinbase is growing exponentially, despite the turbulent market conditions. T Coinbase generated revenue growth of more than 300% year over year in the third quarter, from $287 million in Q3 2020 to $1. 2 billion in Q3 2021. Moreover, the company is operating at a high level of capital efficiency, reporting a 54% net profit margin through the first nine months of 2021, compared to 21% for the same period in 2020. Several Wall Street titans have recently expressed their thoughts about the sell-off in crypto. ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood suggested that uncertainty in the broader macroeconomic environment has investors resorting to cash as a safety net. As the value of the dollar increases, it pushes down the value of other assets such as stocks and crypto. Cryptocurrency is now experiencing its own version of the valuation compression that high-growth technology stocks experienced during the final months of 2021. Wood referred to the correction in technology stocks and cryptocurrency markets as “deep value territory,” signaling that she is optimistic about these innovative companies and applications in the long run. Moreover, Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pandl recently published a client note forecasting that Bitcoin could reach a long-term price target of $100,000 should it continue taking market share away from other hedge assets such as gold. It is important to understand that cryptocurrencies can be an intimidating asset class due to the overwhelming number of tokens to choose from and their myriad uses. The underlying volatility of cryptocurrencies may also drive negative investor sentiment, leaving many to think that it’s too late to get involved. But Wall Street’s long-term positive sentiment on cryptocurrencies could bode well for Coinbase and investors. The rise of NFTs The introduction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has opened up a new world beyond traditional cryptocurrency tokens. An NFT is a type of digital asset that can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artwork, recordings, virtual real estate, or virtual pets. OpenSea, a privately held NFT marketplace, benefited from the rising enthusiasm around the cryptocurrency space during 2021. The company and its investors are confident that this enthusiasm is here to stay, as it recently announced that it raised $300 million in Series C financing and is now valued at $13. 3 billion. For reference, as of the time of this writing, OpenSea’s valuation represents roughly 20% of Coinbase’s market capitalization. In December 2021, OpenSea processed more than $2. 4 billion in transaction volume, and generated hundreds of millions in fees last year. This growth in NFTs has not gone unnoticed by Coinbase. In October 2021, the company reported that it was planning to launch its own NFT marketplace in 2022. Bank of America recently upgraded Coinbase stock from neutral to buy, citing revenue diversification beyond traditional retail cryptocurrency trading as a catalyst. Now what? Coinbase’s revenue has increased far more dramatically than its costs over the last 12 months. For this reason, the company has reached a level of financial flexibility allowing it to invest in new product development that could unlock diverse revenue streams. As Coinbase looks to evolve beyond a cryptocurrency trading platform, the stock is hovering near an all-time-low valuation of 9 times its trailing-12-month sales. Although 2022 has started with a compressed valuation in technology stocks and cryptocurrencies, the long-term positive sentiment from Wall Street and the recent decline in cryptocurrency prices at large make Coinbase a compelling long-term investment. As the company trades near all-time lows, now may be an attractive entry point for investors looking for exposure to the cryptocurrency market. "

    "title": "Cryptoland wants to be an NFT paradise—it sounds like a digital FyreFest",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - Cryptoland, ostensibly an island where decentralized, blockchain technology reigns and a better society develops from it, launched this month with a hype video as outlandish as the concept itself. But given its dubious nature and the general concerns about the scammy nature of cryptocurrency and the NFTs in general, it’s just as possible the kick-off video was for a digital FyreFest. The two “luxury island” projects, Fyre—a music festival in the Bahamas—and Cryptoland, a crypto-paradise in Fiji, promise an extravagant getaway experience for exclusive guests in promotional videos detached from reality. FyreFest collapsed in a wake of scandal and stranded concertgoers. It remains to see what becomes of Cryptoland, but a quick look at the founders’ history doesn’t inspire confidence. Cryptoland’s newfound virality is not due to the project’s vision, but instead its nine-minute animated advertisement that crypto Twitter has been quick to ridicule. The animation supposedly took a year to create, as the founders of the project stated in their promotional video. The viral video (though it went private a few days after it took off on Twitter) contained a nine-minute animated portion, though a 16-minute extended cut was recently unearthed. The Pixar-esque video itself can only be described as unhinged. @molly0xFFF Hi Molly. I’ve created a side-by-side comparison video of the 2 versions of the animation. I’ve added a comprehensive list of changes in this Twitter thread. https://t. co/TXqbNI7fpf — James Pain (@jpainio) January 8, 2022 Overflowing with crypto in-jokes and references, the video intends to convey Cryptoland as Disneyland for crypto enthusiasts. Instead, it comes across as a crypto bro-dom from hell, edging so close to satire that it’s hard to believe the project isn’t a parody of the crypto world. There’s an incredible lack of diversity and in no way passes either the Bechdel Test or the Racial Bechdel Test. Aside from the animation, probing into the past of founders Max Oliver and Helena Lopez reveals a string of failed projects, name changes, a cease-and-desist letter, and various misdirections. Are the two entrepreneurs with a less than stellar past really qualified to purchase and develop an entire island with the hope of creating a crypto paradise? Oliver and Lopez declined to comment to the Daily Dot about Cryptoland. How does Cryptoland intend to work? The project is releasing 10,000 NFTs (non-fungible tokens) called “Cryptolanders,” of which 60 are “King Cryptolanders. ” The regular Cryptolanders are free, in theory, while the King Cryptolanders are the big-ticket items. At 319 Ethereum (ETH), right now they cost just over $1 million. Purchasing a King version grants the holder a one-acre plot on the future physical island. Owning a King Cryptolander NFT is considered proof of ownership of one of 60 parcels of land on the future Cryptoland island. It appears, essentially, to be an online deed marketed as an NFT. Blockchain technology is outpacing the laws, so though the technology allows for the possibility of land transferal via an NFT, it’s murky whether it holds under current law and tax guidelines. Experiments in the merging of crypto and the real estate industry have been successfully attempted, like in 2017 when TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington sold his Kyiv apartment as an NFT. The process to integrate NFTs and property sales is slightly more complex than that of the more common NFT digital art collection: a separate LLC was formed where the property ownership was held and the NFT would transfer ownership of the LLC to any future buyers of that property’s associated NFT. Cryptoland’s “Why” paper explains briefly how the title ownership will be passed to the King Cryptoland holders, but not the legal mechanics of the transferal. Any holder of a Cryptolander NFT of either kind has access to visit the island, once it is built. A Cryptolander is free to mint, and if you’re a holder of the big NFT collections including Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, Fidenza and CyberKongz, you’ll get automatic access to mint. Otherwise, you’ll have to work through a detailed process including a Twitter raid, changing your usernames and profiles to include Cryptoland, inviting new members, and spam commenting various tweets, as outlined on the project’s Discord. Regular Cryptolanders are currently reselling at around $350. The $1 million price tag on a King Cryptolander NFT grants the owner a designated plot of land on the island, but not a house. The land owners must pay for and plan all development on their plots. Regular Crypolanders, or those who have access to the island but not land ownership, may stay at a planned resort on the island or presumably on the mainland a kilometer away. The project’s viral promotional video introduces its two founders, Oliver and Lopez. The pair have little online presence upon first glance: their social media and online presence is minimal outside of hits directly related to Cryptoland. For an undertaking as large as developing an island, little information on the two can be found. Search hard enough, and you’ll eventually stumble upon a Spanish-language article titled “Paparazis, acoso y fotos robadas: el hombre al que odian todos los ‘youtubers’ españoles,” or essentially, “the man all YouTubers hate. ” In it, Oliver’s full name is listed in the piece as Maxim Oliver Jubin Coll. A search with Oliver’s full name reveals much more: his own dedicated Wikipedia page, which delineates his acting career and his pro-skater era. It was in the 2015 movie Stones from the Desert, co-directed by Oliver and his brother, when Oliver appears to have met Lopez, who was cast in the lead female role. After Stones from the Desert, Oliver and Lopez started a new project attempting to capitalize on the newly forming YouTuber space. They formed the company Play Group Spain SL to create and host the YouTuber-focused Play Awards, the first awards ceremony of its kind. The first ceremony was a moderate success, but the second was wrapped in scandal, eventually leading to its cancelation. Oliver was tied to the creation of the YouMag magazine, a publication dedicated to scandals and rumors in the YouTuber world. Its first and only issue published controversial photos of Spanish-Norwegian YouTuber El Rubius and his previously anonymous girlfriend. The paparazzi stalking was described as “hunting” by El Rubius and fans agreed the magazine had taken things too far. The public backlash to the paparazzi scandal led to its closure after just one issue. El Rubius later called for a boycott of the Play Awards, citing Oliver’s involvement. A press release from the Play Awards team denied rumors that Oliver was involved with the second awards ceremony, though later stated that he was an investor. However, a second unearthed Cryptoland video focusing on the background of the founders states the history of Oliver and Lopez’s founding of Play Group Spain SL, even highlighting a shot of Oliver signing his name on a Play Group Spain SL company document. While they were still active, the YouMag domain, as well as the Play Awards site both pointed to Play Group Spain SL as the site owner. Shortly after, playawards. es transferred domain ownership to Helena López Jurado, so the pair’s involvement remained. From the Play Awards press release denying Oliver’s connection to the domain name transferal, Oliver and Lopez have a clear history of “disappearing” their involvement in their failed projects. Spanish YouTuber Locobs reportedly received an email from Oliver asking him to remove his video explaining the connection between Oliver and YouMag. And it’s all happening again. Software engineer Molly White, whose Twitter thread digging into the project sounded the alarm to Cryptoland’s red flags, has received a cease and desist letter claiming her statements “defame both Cryptoland and its founders. ” Then there’s the question of the island itself. Cryptoland has released an “Approval in Principle” document, which appears to be a development agreement between Blocklands Development Limited and the Rakiraki Town Council for the creation of Cryptoland. The island identified in this document is Nananu-I-Cake, a 600-acre island approximately one kilometer from Fiji’s largest island. The caveat: Nananu-I-Cake is still listed for sale on an online private island marketplace, priced at $12 million. The Approval in Principle document indicates discussion between Fiji officials and Cryptoland representatives has taken place, but it is not clear if the project currently has the rights to the island. The Cryptoland community Discord’s bot bans links to the marketplace listing for Nananu-I-Cake. A source familiar with the project said that planning approval has been sought for Cryptoland and development documents have been drawn up, but that the development has recently been put on hold. In case anyone actually wants to purchase a Cryptoland plot of land on Nananu-I-Cake, the prospective buyers must click an “I’m not a U. S. Citizen” checkbox. In the project’s “Why” paper, the restriction against American citizens, residents, and green card holders purchasers is written in legalese not once, not twice, but three times. It’s not clear why Americans are theoretically excluded, because the first (and only) King Cryptoland holder is crypto entrepreneur Kyle Chassé, who is an American. How he circumvented the nationality barrier is unclear. On the morning of Nov. 8, 2021, the Crypoland account tweeted that the first to become a King Cryptolander would receive a 50% discount. That afternoon, Chassé purchased King Cryptolander #1, and per the price of ETH at the time, spent approximately $750,000, as recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Aside from the million-dollar King Cryptolander sales, the project intends to fund itself through secondary sales of their regular Cryptolander NFTs. The “Why” paper, along with the master plan, states Cryptoland earns a 5% royalty on any resale of their 10,000 NFTs. The trading volume of the project to date is 37. 9 ETH, so their 5% royalty would yield just about $6,000 in total. There are mistakes and discrepancies abound in Cryptoland’s public documents. Most notable is their clear “replace all”-ing of their entire “Why” paper. Any time the letters k, i, n, and g appear sequentially, it’s capitalized to “King,” which they likely did to catch all the “King Cryptolander” capitalization. Unrecorded The Cryptoland team itself has major red flags. The project’s creative designer, repeatedly cited in videos and on the site as Bartosz Domiczek, stated in an Instagram DM that he is not affiliated with the project whatsoever. Lol… Hey @cryptoland – you got anything to say about this? One of the staff you advertise on your website is not affiliated with your project at all. Sounds like a scam to me! pic. twitter. com/8LXf13od1V — GET SOME (@Hahaitsfunny) January 7, 2022 Altogether, it paints a picture of an island that is never going to happen. But given the inexplicable, exploding popularity of NFTs, the market was ripe for a massive flop. Update 10:38am CT: Domiczek told the Daily Dot that he is not associated with the project. He said worked on concept development “a couple of years ago” but the project “visually landed pretty far from where it used to be at the beginning. ” He added that he was not “involved in the process later on. ” "

We’ve maintained this reputation for over four decades by demystifying the financial decision-making process and giving people confidence in which actions to take next. While we adhere to strict editorial integrity , this post may contain references to products from our partners. Here’s an explanation for how we make money . Crypto. com is going to be a good fit for cryptocurrency traders who are looking to trade one of the widest selections of cryptocurrencies in the industry. You’ll be able to trade well beyond the most popular cryptocurrencies, with more than 250 available. It will all be available to you through a slick mobile app that makes trading on the go easy. Like many other crypto platforms, customer service leaves something to be desired. With no customer service representatives available over the phone, you’ll have to rely on the FAQ page and online chat to get your questions answered. Customers looking to trade more than just crypto will also be disappointed. If you’re ok with a more limited selection of cryptocurrencies to trade, you might be better off with Robinhood or Webull, where you’ll also be able to trade stocks and ETFs. Best for Wide selection of cryptocurrencies Staking Crypto-only traders Crypto. com at a glance Category Crypto. com Minimum balance: None, but $1 trade minimum Securities tradable: More than 250 cryptocurrencies Cost per trade: Fees starting at 0. 4 percent No deposit fee Withdrawal fees vary by cryptocurrency Customer service: No phone service, only self-help and chat Mobile app: The Crypto. com mobile app is available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store Pros: Where Crypto. com stands out Cryptocurrency selection Crypto. com really separates itself from other trading apps by offering more than 250 cryptocurrencies, among the best in the industry. Other cryptocurrency apps offer only the most popular coins, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and others. But with Crypto. com, you’ll find those popular cryptocurrencies along with more obscure ones like Polygon and Helium, as well as others you may have never heard of. It’s worth noting that not all cryptocurrencies are available in every state, so be sure to check if a coin you’re interested in is available in your location before getting started. The Crypto. com app is not available at all in New York state. Financial apps that offer trading in other securities along with crypto typically only offer a handful of coins. Robinhood offers commission-free trading in seven cryptocurrencies, while Webull offers more than 20 and says it is working to add more. Coinbase is another option if you’re looking for a wide selection of cryptocurrencies, but with about 125 coins available it falls short of Crypto. com’s offering. Be aware that if you’re looking to trade non-crypto securities, you’ll need to open an account with a broker such as Schwab or Fidelity. No fees on bank transfers Crypto. com won’t charge you a fee to transfer money from your bank account to its platform, which makes it the ideal choice for funding your account. Other funding options, like using a credit card, come with fees of nearly 3 percent. An automated clearing house, or ACH, transfer typically takes three to five business days and comes with a minimum amount of $20 and a daily limit of $100,000. You can also fund an account through a wire transfer, which is a bit faster at one to two business days but requires at least $1,000 to be transferred per transaction. The daily maximum for a wire transfer is $1,000,000. Staking Crypto. com allows customers to hold deposits of cryptocurrency with it and earn rewards in return. The practice, known as staking, is similar to a bank savings account that pays interest, but with significantly greater risks. You’ll be able to earn rewards on more than 40 different cryptocurrencies at Crypto. com and interest is paid weekly. As of January 2022, you could earn up to 14. 5 percent a year by staking with Crypto. com. Staking with Bitcoin and Ethereum can earn up to 8. 5 percent a year. Remember that traditional bank accounts are protected by FDIC insurance, which allows you to recover up to $250,000 in the event of a bank’s failure. Crypto staking does not come with any similar insurance policy and you also face the market risk of losing your principal if the cryptocurrency declines in value. Cons: Where Crypto. com could improve Fees Crypto. com comes in at the high end of the range for trading fees compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges. Most traders starting out will pay 0. 4 percent on transactions, but that number does decline if you’re an active trader. Most other exchanges charge 0. 2 – 0. 35 percent and Binance. US comes in at just 0. 1 percent. Crypto. com uses a maker-taker pricing model that, at high volumes, rewards those that provide liquidity (makers) and charges a slightly higher price to those that reduce it (takers). Here’s a breakdown of how the fees change with increasing volumes. 30-day volume Maker Taker Less than $25,000 0. 40 percent 0. 40 percent $25,001 – $50,000 0. 35 percent 0. 35 percent $50,001 – $100,000 0. 15 percent 0. 25 percent $100,001 – $250,000 0. 10 percent 0. 16 percent $250,001 – $1 million 0. 09 percent 0. 15 percent $1,000,001 – $20 million 0. 08 percent 0. 14 percent $20,000,001 – $100 million 0. 07 percent 0. 13 percent $100,000,001 – $200 million 0. 06 percent 0. 12 percent $200 million and up 0. 04 percent 0. 10 percent A discount of 10 percent is available for customers who stake CRO, Crypto. com’s own cryptocurrency, and pay trading fees in CRO. Other exchanges, including Kraken and Binance. US, don’t charge fees to makers once a certain level of trading volume is reached, but Crypto. com charges a small fee at even the highest volumes. Educational material If you’re new to cryptocurrency and are looking to learn more about it, you’ll need to go somewhere other than Crypto. com. While some questions are answered through the online help center, they’re mostly focused on how to perform different functions through the app, rather than educating traders about crypto. Cryptocurrency has attracted many new traders, many of whom don’t understand how trading works or the many intricacies of crypto. Crypto. com has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, including a tv spot with actor Matt Damon and a naming rights deal for the old Staples Center in Los Angeles. Surely, it could invest some money into more educational content to help novice traders. Customer service Like many cryptocurrency trading apps, Crypto. com does not offer phone support as part of its customer service offering. You’ll have to rely on a help center that’s only available online and focuses more on account funding questions and certain product features. There is a chat option within the app for questions, but some customers prefer talking to an actual person on the phone. Bottom line Crypto. com gives traders looking for the widest selection of cryptocurrencies a solid option. You’ll be able to deposit funds from a bank account to the mobile app without paying a fee and you can earn solid returns through the platform’s staking program. Remember that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and are a poor substitute for cash. Trading fees are high, especially for customers who don’t plan on being active traders. Discounts are available if you plan to trade frequently. Crypto. com would also benefit from improved educational resources and a customer service option that includes talking to an expert on the phone. For crypto-focused exchanges with lower fees, traders might consider Binance or Kraken. If you’re looking for just the most popular coins, general investing apps like Robinhood and Webull might be a better fit.

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Late last year the cryptocurrency Squid burst on to the scene with much fanfare and ended up spraying a lot of red ink. Inspired by the Netflix series “Squid Game”, Squid began trading at a price of just one penny and surged to $2,856 before sinking to the bottom of the crypto sea, after its anonymous founders cashed out. More than 40,000 people still held the token after the crash and analysts believe Squid’s developers made off with $3. 8 million. The Squid scam has been described as a rug pull, where developers of a cryptocurrency project — typically a new token — abandon it unexpectedly, taking users’ funds with them. In June 2021, self-made billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban took a hit on Titan cryptocurrency, which spectacularly lost all its value in a day. Rug pulls were a big factor in 2021, accounting for 37% of all cryptocurrency scam revenue in 2021, compared with 1% in 2020, the data firm Chainalysis said. Kim Kardashian Sued For Promoting An Alleged Scam Many social media influencers, celebrities and even executives have been paid to pump tokens or projects online. But that doesn’t mean it’s valuable or a good investment. Feeding into social media hype will often result in money lost, experts say. Kim Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather, and basketball player Paul Pierce were sued earlier this week by investors, who accuse them of collaborating with the cryptocurrency EthereumMax to deceive them. The class action claims EthereumMax operated a “pump and dump” scheme - where misleading marketing is used to inflate the price of an asset then sold to unwitting investors at a profit. As the SEC warned in 2017, “it is never a good idea to make an investment decision just because someone famous says a product or service is a good investment. ” Cryptocurrency-based crime hit a new all-time high in 2021, according to Chainalysis, with illicit addresses receiving $14 billion over the course of the year, up from $7. 8 billion in 2020. On Monday, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) said that investments related to cryptocurrencies and digital assets is the top investor threat “by far. ” The association warned about crypto investment scams that guaranteed high returns with no risk. “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” the association said. Fake prizes, Giveaways, Sweepstakes Fake prizes, giveaways or sweepstakes are another brand of ripoff, where a scam page could be mistaken for a real philanthropic campaign. There are also celebrity impersonators waiting to take your money. Scammers impersonating Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report CEO Elon Musk reportedly stole over $2 million last year. Email phishing attacks are another source of crypto crime where consumers receive a message from what appears to be a prominent crypto investor and click on to an attachment. And then there are bogus initial coin offerings (ICO). Indian authorities believe at least 900 people were recently cheated in a fake ICO scam. In all fairness, Chainalysis said things on the crypto crime front are actually getting better. The report noted that the growth of legitimate cryptocurrency usage is far outpacing the growth of criminal usage, and that illicit activity’s share of cryptocurrency transaction volume has never been lower. Though it’s impossible to find a sure bet, experts recommend investors fully understand the risks surrounding cryptocurrency, before buying in. "

Daly contested the full IndyCar season in 2021 but divided his duties between the Carpenter squad and Carlin, contesting the oval events for the latter. Carpenter has announced a “multi-year” deal with BitNile which will see Daly drive their number 20 car in all 17 races of this year’s championship, which begins at St Petersburg next month. Daly placed 18th in the championship last year. The team subsequently announced it had lost the backing of the US Air Force which sponsored Daly’s car in 2021. This year will be the first time Daly has contested every round of the IndyCar series for the same team since his 2017 stint at Foyt. “Being chosen to represent BitNile is without a doubt one of the most important opportunities of my career,” he said. “This is an incredible partnership that we look forward to being able to strengthen and grow as we go after race wins together. ” As well as being the primary sponsor of Daly’s car, BitNile will be an associate sponsor of the number 21 Carpenter entry driven by Rinus VeeKay. Carpenter ran sponsorship from cryptocurrency, Bitcon, on VeeKay’s car at the Indianapolis 500 last year. Team owner Ed Carpenter will drive a third car for the team at this year’s Indy 500.

    "body": "2022/01/15 - CARDANO has gone through a long slump - can it be reversed in 2022? The blockchain’s ADA cryptocurrency soared during the first half of 2021 and became the third largest by August - after Bitcoin and Ethereum. 1 We reveal price predictions for the Cardano crypto, also known as ADA But it is now languishing in seventh place - having fallen in value by more than half since September last year. Cardano was launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson - one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Every time someone buys or sells the cryptocurrency, it’s permanently recorded on the platform’s blockchain. Keen investors should be aware that it’s not a guaranteed way to make money though - and you can lose all the cash you put in. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose or into something you don’t understand. Cryptocurrencies are also especially volatile, and their values can make large swings at no notice. There’s scant regulation for crypto firms, so you’ll find yourself without protection if and when things go wrong. What’s the price of Cardano? The value of Cardano is currently sitting at $1. 27, according to CoinMarketCap. The price has fallen by 0. 11% over the past 24 hours. (AD) An easier way to buy crypto with eToro Join the 25 million users who trust their investments with eToro. You can start investing from as little as $10. Choose from a selection of crypto assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin. You can practice risk-free, with a virtual investment account. Own crypto with eToro Cryptocurrency investing within the EU (by eToro Europe Ltd. and eToro UK Ltd. ) &amp; USA (by eToro USA LLC) is highly volatile, unregulated in most EU countries and the UK. No consumer protection. Not supervised by the EU or UK regulatory framework. Investments are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Tax on profits may apply. Cardano hit its highest ever level on September 1, when it reached $3. 10. Investors in the cryptocurrency are hoping for a recovery-filled 2022 for ADA. In fact, Neural Prophet has predicted its price could reach $3. 60 by March. Price predictions for Cardano in 2022 The value of any cryptocurrency is highly volatile, meaning it’s impossible to know its future price for certain. Yet plenty of experts have made predictions for Cardano, but it’s important to take them with a pinch of salt as they’re not guaranteed. The cryptocurrency market is affected by a number of factors, including regulatory crackdowns and comments by high-profile individuals. CoinPriceForecast now estimates Cardano will hit $1. 43 by the end of 2022 - up from its $1. 34 prediction for mid-year. That’s a 13% rise. The coin forecaster then projects that it will hit $2. 67 by the end of 2024. In other words, investors hoping for a $10 value will likely be waiting several years - and crossing their fingers. What do the experts say? Experts are urging keen investors to only invest money that they can afford to lose, whether it’s Cardano or any other cryptocurrency. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has previously warned: “Much of the demand for these coins and tokens have come from traders hoping to benefit from future price rises rather than using them as a means of exchange. “Gains are often being fuelled by frenzied chat across social media with influencers jostling for position to push their favoured coins. “But like a slot machine, many of the coins being pushed into circulation are very much a speculative bet and investors should only get involved if they have money they can afford to lose. ” In other cryptocurrency news, the UK’s first crypto cafe has opened - and you can pay in seven types of digital cash. Here are our Dogecoin price predictions for 2022. But there’s a warning for all crypto investors about a new scam.

    "body": "2022/01/15 - A new meme coin seems to have taken the crypto world by storm. Alien Shiba Inu (ASHIB), apparently inspired by Shiba Inu, witnessed a massive 1,344 percent growth in value over the last week. While new crypto assets often gain massive popularity overnight, many of them turn out to be Ponzi schemes in which investors have lost a significant amount of money. Unpredictability and volatility are inevitable parts of cryptocurrency trading. Big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum started the new year with high hopes, but they have yet to see growth. Bitcoin has also witnessed a downward trend since the start of this year. While there are no direct red flags that indicate Alien Shiba Inu is a scam, there is also very little information available on the coin and the projects that the Alien Shiba Inu community would be concentrating on in near future. It is also worth mentioning that the coin’s rapid growth in value has slowed significantly in the last two days. According to CoinGecko, the value of Alien Shiba Inu rose by 500 percent in a single day on January 9 after the cryptocurrency was trading at a historic low, before unexpectedly soaring. Many people have been amazed by Alien Shiba Inu’s meteoric growth. Experts have warned those contemplating jumping on the bandwagon to make a fast buck to move with caution, pointing out that there is less information available about this new coin. The developers of this coin simply mention on their website that they are functioning on “three flagship utility projects”: A collection of NFT characters for play-to-earn gaming, a decentralised exchange (DEX), and AlienShibaInuCrew, a merchandise marketplace. The coin, however, is still unavailable for trading on a number of exchanges, despite its November launch. On CoinMarketCap, it is ranked at number 3,673. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - The Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit organization, is offering remote tech professionals and entrepreneurs $10,000 in bitcoin to move to the region. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is currently trading at around $42,893, according to Coin Metrics. Why bitcoin? “Northwest Arkansas is experiencing explosive growth in the tech sector, specifically within blockchain-enabled technologies, and this incentive embraces the growing trend of cryptocurrency as a payment option by employers,” its website reads. The incentive is part of the NWA Council’s “Life Works Here” campaign, which is funded by the Walton Family Foundation. When it first launched in 2020, the NWA Council initially offered $10,000 cash as an incentive program. It recently decided to add the option for remote workers to accept the amount in bitcoin instead, although they can still choose cash if they prefer. “While we’ve had overwhelming interest in the initial incentive program, we’re continuing to seek out unique and in-demand talent in the STEAM and blockchain professions,” the website says. In order to be eligible, applicants must relocate to Northwest Arkansas, which includes Washington and Benton counties, within six months of acceptance to the program and sign a one-year lease or buy a home. Applicants also must be at least 24 years old, have at least two years of work experience, currently live outside of the state of Arkansas and be a U. S. citizen or have the credentials required to work legally in the U. S. , according to the program’s website. In addition to the money, the NWA Council is also offering to gift remote workers a bicycle, highlighting the region’s mountain biking trails, or a free membership to local theaters and museums. So far, over 35,000 people have applied from more than 115 countries and 50 states, the NWA Council says.

    "body": "2022/01/15 - When Beeple’s digital artwork, ‘Everydays: the First 5000 Days’ sold for $69. 3 million in March last year, it put a sharp focus on the growing world of ‘non-fungible tokens’ or NFTs. It also put the spotlight on its buyer MetaKovan, whose identity was revealed later. But for MetaKovan, whose real name is Vignesh Sundaresan, investing in an NFT or blockchain is nothing new. The India-born and now Singapore-based “cryptocurrency king”, as he is known, has been an early investor in the NFT space. In a conversation with indianexpress. com over a video call, MetaKovan outlined his thoughts on the metaverse, NFTs, cryptocurrency, and why children will play an important role in the new digital era. Here is an edited version of the interaction. On NFTs, metaverse and why it belongs to the next generation NFT are digitally native items. And the online world is becoming like a companion to every child. Look at the trend of how early kids start playing games. Look at platforms like Roblox, which is at $40 billion in valuation. And that’s because of the revenue and user growth and primarily, it is driven by kids. That’s why I think NFTs are very interesting because of this digitally native generation. These users will give more importance to their persona and expression online and how they can express themselves. Usually, it’s via a fashionable dress, shoes, sneakers, etc. But online NFTs take that part. And that’s why for a digitally native life NFTs will become the core asset. On investing in cryptocurrency I have always recommended people not to invest in cryptocurrency. I always say invest your time and maybe learn about cryptocurrency. There is always an opportunity for one to be part of a system and earn cryptocurrency. So, I always recommend people to do that if they do want to be exposed to it in some way. I think patience and relevance are very important for every individual. You’ll get the conviction to hold on to cryptocurrency only if you work on it, or else you will sell it the moment it goes up. According to MetaKovan, crypto has become a tool of coordination between human beings. According to MetaKovan, crypto has become a tool of coordination between human beings. I also feel fairness is something crypto strives for. I don’t have any Bitcoin because I think it’s not fair. And so I will be in a different chain. And you can be in a different chain too. We are going into a multi-chain world where there is this iteration to get to fairness. I think this crypto revolution will go on until people feel it’s fair. On ‘decentralised’ web, ‘interoperability’ and the challenges Look, decentralisation is also a process. And where it is happening is a very different space than just the obvious things. This is similar to the notion of a public park and how public parks cannot be privatised. Public parks serve the public good. So in the same way, I think the internet is what we are seeing now, is that there is all this private web and there is no public or shared infrastructure. There will be points of centralisation, etc of course. But what we are literally building now is a public park on the internet. Ideally, as they become public parks, they’ll have more value is my thesis. On Meta entering the metaverse I think every system will have its own pros and cons. And for example, Meta, if it is such a centrally planned system, it’s more like modern China. I feel like who would want to become artists there. And if it’s monetarily incentivised, it’s going to attract a specific kind of people. But all these things are going to co-exist and that is the most interesting part. I think as a user you can choose which system you want to be a part of. Crypto has become a tool of coordination for human beings. You can put up your own experiment here as an economic experiment and that could also become big. I am not really too concerned about Meta. But I like the fact that people already hate them. On cryptocurrency and regulations Crypto is a shapeshifting organism. When the government wanted to figure out Bitcoin, it took nearly eight years. And then there are NFTs and maybe the government will take its time—another four-five years to regulate that. And then there will be something else in the next three to four years. Because of the shape-shifting nature of crypto, the regulations will always lag and that lag is where innovation will happen. "

(Left: Getty Images, Right: Tesla) Tesla owners can apparently earn up to $800 per month in crypto by using their cars to mine Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based currencies, at least according to one expert. Tesla Model 3 owner and Bitcoin miner Siraj Raval recently appeared on Fox Business’ Varney &amp; Co. to explain how his Tesla can mine crypto with his simple tips. Watch the latest video at foxbusiness. com Using an Apple M1 laptop equipped with the namesake chip, Raval plugs into the Tesla’s cigarette lighter outlet, connects to the on-board Wi-Fi, and accesses Honeyminer to start making crypto cash. “And then it’s just mining. There you go,” he said. “Nothing else necessary… You can run it 24 hours a day, and if you plug your car in in your garage, it’s always powered. It’s a really simple way to do it. ” Tesla Raval added that he doesn’t know of any other Tesla owners who have managed to mine crypto with their cars. However CNBC reports that YouTuber K-Man, aka Chris Allessi, has transformed his Tesla Model S into a crypto mining machine by plugging a Bitmain Antminer S9 rig into the car’s battery via a power inverter. As an employee at Polygon—the No. 13 cryptocurrency in the world—the idea came naturally to Raval. “So, I get paid in crypto, all my funds are in crypto,” he said, adding that Polygon’s goal is to scale Ethereum so it may be widely adopted. “I don’t believe in the U. S. dollar. I mostly just have cryptocurrency, and I think we’re going to get to a very hyperinflated state soon, so I’m just all-in on crypto in every way. ” Watch the video above to see learn it’s done. "

A review with its performance between 2018 and 2021, the space of three years has increased the volume of setbacks globally. Though the year 2021 gave a great historic increase for the market performance of the entire crypto ecosystem, it also accounted for more slamming on digital assets. The number of countries or jurisdictions with restrictive laws on cryptocurrency doubles in 2021 compared to 2018.       Related Reading   Think Bitcoin Is Bearish? Check Out These Mining Stocks   According to the Library of Congress (LOC), there are currently nine jurisdictions with an absolute ban on crypto, while 42 employ an implicit ban. The first report in 2018 shows that the statistics are up from 8 and 15 respectively. As listed by LOC, the nine countries with an absolute ban on crypto include Oman, Qatar, Algeria, Egypt, China, Morocco, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Tunisia. China’s crypto ban in 2021 attracted the most attention among all the countries on the list. The Library of Congress (LOC) is the US Senate’s research library. Also, it acts as the country’s national library. The LOC report specified its contextual definition for both an absolute ban and an implicit ban. According to the report, an absolute ban is defined as holding cryptocurrency or transactions, a criminal act. On the other hand, an implicit ban prevents crypto exchanges, banks, or financial firms from engaging in crypto transactions or providing services in crypto. Hope For Countries To Lift Ban On Cryptocurrency Sector The gradual rise through the past three years in the jurisdictions banning and restrictions in cryptocurrency is quite alarming. Moreover, there is no visible drop as more governments are now reconsidering their crypto stance. Besides the total of 51 jurisdictions that have a crypto ban, about 103 countries have enforced some strict laws and measures. These include the application of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combatting the Funding of Terrorism (CFT) laws. The number gives a triple increase compared to the 2018 value of 33 jurisdictions having such laws. A similar move is the November ban on Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining from a Swedish financial regulatory body and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The ban was because of the power requirement and environmental costs of operating the networks. However, Melanion Capital, a Paris-based firm, criticized the ban. The firm labeled the claims against mining as misinformation.

The application of the rules is expected to alter the meaning of virtual asset service providers. Also, it will introduce an implicit ban on Bitcoin and DeFi. On its part, the Indian government scared its residents through the move of its lawmakers to ban crypto last year. Though the result was no outright ban, they meted out strict regulations on cryptocurrencies. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView. com "

    "title": "Cryptocurrency: El Salvador’s experiment has shown regulation must be part of the future of bitcoin",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - Last autumn El Salvador became the first, and as yet only, nation to adopt bitcoin as a legal currency. When El Salvador’s congress rubber stamped President Nayib Bukele’s proposal to embrace the cryptocurrency alongside the US dollar it was heralded as a decision which would bring financial inclusion and investment. President Bukele said the adoption of bitcoin would also make it easier for those living abroad to send money home and the $4bn (£2. 8bn) they send back each year accounts for 20 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Get financial advice and industry news, to you help manage your money Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem. But the law was reliant on businesses having the technology to process the transactions and there was an added complication, El Salvador had asked the International Monetary Fund for a $1bn loan; a request that was later rejected. Katharine Wooller, managing director, of crypto wealth platform Dacxi, said that the launch had been accompanied by problems, the platform on which the bitcoin was held ended up crashing and a $30 incentive to set up a bitcoin account had not gone down well. She said: “As with the adoption of the euro in Europe, it has not been met with unmitigated enthusiasm – indeed some (mostly the older generation) in El Salvador felt compelled to protest in the streets against the policy. ” Over the following weeks the decision appeared vindicated as bitcoin rose from its value at transition, $42,600, to an all-time high of $65,500 a few weeks later. She pointed out the gain was short lived, and bitcoin’s price has since corrected sharply to $43,700. Despite teething problems Ms Wooller does believe crypto has a future as a legal but decentralised financial asset, rather than a currency. “Its volatility does need to be addressed but at the moment many of those who are holding bitcoin are doing so as a hedge against potential inflation, and thus are using it as a store of value akin to gold rather than as a currency. ” Ms Wooller believed regulation of cryptocurrency would emerge, because many of the world’s central banks are in the process of producing their own version of a decentralised currency. “Whilst clearly robust regulatory supervision is needed to facilitate crypto interacting with traditional financial infrastructure, the appeal is precisely because being decentralised it is immune to interference by government. ” She dismissed fears that a decentralised currency could destabilise economies. She said: “Those who are aghast at the major economies printing money with wanton abandon are therefore highly motivated to purchase reputable crypto, which at a government and financial institution level provides a huge potential market. “The technology itself is already turning heads in economic policy, as the majority of the world’s central banks are considering digitising their currency, and pilot projects are already underway, such as in China, gaining good traction. ” "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - New York (CNN Business) North Korean hackers stole nearly $400 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, making it one of the most lucrative years to date for cybercriminals in the severely isolated country, according to a new report. Hackers launched at least seven different attacks last year, primarily targeting investment firms and centralized exchanges with a variety of tactics, including phishing, malware and social engineering, according to the report from Chainalysis, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency. The cybercriminals worked to gain access to organizations’ “hot” wallets — digital wallets that are connected to the internet — and then move funds into DPRK-controlled accounts. The thefts are the latest indication that the heavily sanctioned country continues to rely on a network of hackers to help fund its domestic programs. A confidential United Nations report previously accused the regime of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, of conducting “operations against financial institutions and virtual currency exchange houses” to pay for weapons and keep North Korea’s economy afloat. Last February, the US Justice Department charged three North Koreans for conspiring to steal more than $1. 3 billion from banks and companies around the world and orchestrating digital heists of cryptocurrency. “North Korea is, in most respects, cut off from the global financial system by a long sanctions campaign by the US and foreign partners. ” said Nick Carlsen, analyst at blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. “As a result they have taken to the digital battlefield to steal crypto in, essentially, [a] bank robbery at the speed of the internet, to fund weapons programs, nuclear proliferation and other destabilizing activities. ” Read More "

    "title": "First Cryptocurrency ATM Reportedly Installed in Uruguay – Emerging Markets Bitcoin News",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - First Cryptocurrency ATM Reportedly Installed in Uruguay The ostensible first cryptocurrency ATM machine has been installed in Uruguay, developed as a joint initiative between Urubit and Inbierto, two national crypto companies. This represents a milestone for the country, which according to estimates has between 40K and 50K cryptocurrency users, whose primary avenue for purchasing crypto relies on peer-to-peer markets. Uruguay Enters the Crypto ATM Era Uruguay has received its reported first cryptocurrency ATM in its territory, which is already installed in Punta del Este, a city located in the southeast of the country. The cryptocurrency machine was developed by two national crypto companies: Urubit and Inbierto. The former focused on the software part of the system, and the latter provided the hardware for the ATM. Adolfo Varela, Inbierto’s CEO, states that one of the aims of this machine is to create trust in the cryptocurrency market in the country, where most crypto commerce happens in peer-to-peer markets that cannot go through banking due to lack of regulations. With a cryptocurrency ATM, the possibility of being victim to a scam is said to be eliminated. Varela believes they will keep growing and extending their crypto ATM network across the country. He stated: We intend to continue growing in Maldonado, then Colonia, Montevideo and by the end of the year we want to have coverage throughout the national territory. With this it has happened to us that other countries have consulted us to be able to install it. The installed crypto ATM supports only five cryptocurrencies (which include two national tokens): ferret token, urubit, bitcoin, binance coin (BNB), and binance USD (BUSD). The companies have not introduced Ethereum support to the machines because they rely on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to process transactions. Varela explained that Ethereum’s fees would deter users from using the machine, and that’s why BSC integration was opted for instead. Regulation a Gray Area in the Country Cryptocurrency regulation remains as a gray area in the country, but the central bank issued a statement in October last year, declaring these assets were not legal or illegal, and that citizens could use them while being aware of the risks they carry. In a document issued in December, the Central Bank of Uruguay establishes a roadmap for regulating crypto assets, proposing to review current laws and make changes to include them in various existing regulations, instead of creating a virtual asset law to encompass the universe of these assets in just one project. What do you think about the launch of the first crypto ATM in Uruguay? Tell us in the comments section below. Sergio Goschenko Sergio is a cryptocurrency journalist based in Venezuela. He describes himself as late to the game, entering the cryptosphere when the price rise happened during December 2017.

    "title": "Mark Cuban says 80% of his investments that aren't on 'Shark Tank' are crypto-related: Here's 'where I look to invest'",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - Billionaire Mark Cuban is mostly investing in cryptocurrency nowadays. “The investments I’m making now are not in traditional businesses,” Cuban said on a recent episode of “The Problem With Jon Stewart” podcast. In fact, “80% of the investments that I make that are not on ‘Shark Tank’ are in or around cryptocurrencies. ” One type of organization in particular has captured Cuban’s attention: decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. “That is really where I look to invest,” he said. In theory, a DAO is a blockchain-based collective that isn’t governed by one person or entity. Any changes to the DAO’s rules or governance must be voted on by its members. To gain these voting rights, as well as other powers within the organization, investors typically hold the DAO’s governance tokens. “All these new businesses are being formulated now that take this new approach,” Cuban, an investor on ABC’s “Shark Tank” and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said. He added that there will be “game-changing businesses” that come from these types of organizations. In particular, he predicts that industries like banking and insurance are “going to change,” thanks to these new technologies. Cuban is also bullish on smart contracts, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain and power decentralized applications. Smart contracts are instrumental in forming DAOs, as well as in powering other crypto projects, such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. But DAOs and their governance tokens can be risky bets for investors. Financial experts warn to only invest what you can afford to lose, since they deem cryptocurrency to be a volatile and speculative investment. Nonetheless, this positive outlook isn’t particularly surprising from Cuban, who has consistently been outspoken about his belief in smart contracts. Cuban is an avid investor in the crypto space, with a cryptocurrency portfolio of various digital coins, NFTs and investments in many blockchain companies. But even Cuban is realistic about the burgeoning industry. He called the cryptocurrency space casino-like because it’s still so new. “It’s like the early days of the internet,” he told Stewart. “The exact same thing is happening now. It’s 1995 for cryptocurrencies. ” “It’s not to say there aren’t a lot of problems,” Cuban continued. Cryptocurrency “is hard to understand and it’s a hassle. But 10 years from now, there’s going to be those that succeed that will create its own economy. ” Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to “Shark Tank. ” Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter Don’t miss: Mark Cuban says this is ‘the least important part of crypto’ for investors to focus on "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - A CAFÉ has become the first in Britain to accept multiple cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Tayyab Shafiq, 26, has set up the Chai Ada coffee shop in Shepherds Bush, West London, and will be accepting seven different kinds of the popular digital coins. 4 Tayyab has launched the UK’s first cryprocurrency cafe Credit: Darren Fletcher 4 Punters can pay with up to seven different kinds of popular cryptocurrency Credit: Darren Fletcher The menu offers chai teas and coffees, as well as a variety of delicacies – including biriyani, kebabs and desserts. But unlike in other cafes, punters can pay for their morning latte using the completely digital currency. Tayyab will accept the classic Bitcoin as well as Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, Verge, Litecoin and Horizen. Cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance tokens can be extremely volatile, so your cash can go down as well as up in the blink of an eye. Investing is not a guaranteed way to make money, so make sure you know the risks and can afford to lose the money. Speaking to The Sun, Tayaab said: “I honestly believed that crypto is the future, and this is the way that it will be going forward. “Chai Ada has been set up because I really believe that the Metaverse (digital world) is the future, and this is a great way to help encourage the use of cryptocurrency going forward. “Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have the highest market capital but they also have high gas fees, so we wanted to make sure that customers get the best for their money. “It’s a one of a kind café at the moment, and the reason that we offer so many different kinds of cryptocurrency is because of the fees involved in transactions. “The whole café is designed to look great online, and the coffee cups and packaging on the food all have positive messages. ” The entrepreneur hit headlines in 2020 after creating the world’s smallest curry house in a red phone box in Uxbridge, West London. Customers are also being offered ten per cent off their orders for life if they purchase a NFT (non-fungible token) from the café – but only the first few will be able to nab one. NFT’s are limited edition virtual items which can be bought and sold – but have their own unique code so copies cannot be made. I honestly believed that crypto is the future, and this is the way that it will be going forward. Tayyab Shafiq It works as a certification for ownership of a physical asset which means the NFT will effectively function like a rare trading card. The NFT can take the form of a digital image, video file or other virtual asset and is unique, meaning if you buy one, you’re the only person with it. Tayyab added: “It’s really easy to pay with it, and we are also offering a lifetime discount if you purchase an NFT from us. “Anyone who does so will get a discount, in this café and in anything else that we choose to open in the future. ” Cryptocurrencies are digital coins that are stored and can be used to make payments through online technology called the blockchain. Each coin has its own unique code that is stored securely on the blockchain and the same technology has been used in the development of NFTs. Interest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Ripple has soared in the past few months. Bitcoin’s value has been boosted and hit record highs in 2021 after receiving backing from Tesla founder Elon Musk. So, if you’re thinking of investing, keep in mind it’s a risky business and you’re in no way guaranteed to make money. Before jumping in, make sure you know the risks and can afford to lose the cash, and never invest in something you don’t understand. If you do invest, your money won’t be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protects up to £85,000 of your savings if a firm goes bust. You also can’t go to the Financial Ombudsman Service if something goes wrong. Firms offering cryptoassets must now be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and anyone who does invest in cryptocurrencies should check before investing.  5 risks of crypto investments THE Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned people about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies.

    "title": "New Lawsuits Target Cryptocurrency Companies and Their Celebrity Endorsers",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - We highlighted in a recent post regulators’ clear intentions to bring greater order to the cryptocurrency industry this year. The last three weeks have demonstrated that private litigants are not waiting on regulators to rein in alleged bad actors in the crypto marketplace, however. Two new high-profile lawsuits are taking aim at what plaintiffs call fraudulent activity in this booming industry. First, alleging that a publicly-traded cryptocurrency company’s “platform is a house of cards, built on false promises and factually impossible representations that were specifically designed to take advantage of the cryptocurrency craze, to the direct detriment of any ordinary investor,” attorneys filed a putative class action on Christmas Eve against Voyager Digital Ltd. and its subsidiary, Voyager Digital LLC. The pleading claims that the Voyager companies made false representations, including allegedly spurious statements that their cryptocurrency platform is “100% commission-free” and that customers will receive the best possible price on their crypto trades. As a result, according to the complaint, the defendants have reaped billions of dollars in new revenue from persons with little or no investing experience. The complaint also asserts that Voyager failed to disclose that it intentionally set the price on its platform high enough to collect “exorbitant hidden commissions” on each cryptocurrency trade, and that the price of trading was, in fact, more expensive than trades on other platforms. Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is a major stakeholder in Voyager. The complaint alleges that he made comments at a press conference in which he specifically targeted unsophisticated investors “with false and misleading promises of reaping large profits in the cryptocurrency market. ” Counsel for plaintiffs suing the Voyager defendants intend to represent both a nationwide class and a separate Florida class. The putative nationwide class will claim that Voyager violated the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, and is also liable for unjust enrichment. The Florida class, which will allege violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, would consist of people who used the trading platform to place cryptocurrency investment orders. The lawsuit is pending in the Southern District of Florida. Meanwhile, in a separate class action filed earlier this month in the Central District of California, Kim Kardashian and boxer Floyd Mayweather face allegations that they misled investors when promoting a little-known cryptocurrency called EthereumMax to their millions of social media followers. That class action accuses EthereumMax and its celebrity promoters of artificially inflating the price of the token by making “false or misleading statements” in social media posts. An Instagram post by Kardashian last year promoted the EthereumMax cryptocurrency, allegedly spurring a substantial amount of investment activity by unwary investors. “Are you guys into crypto????” Kardashian wrote. “This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends just told me about the Ethereum Max token!” Kardashian proceeded to lavish praise on this new currency. Mayweather endorsed the token in his boxing match with YouTube star Logan Paul. EthereumMax was, in fact accepted as payment for tickets to the event, a move the lawsuit contends led to significant upticks in trading volumes. Mayweather also allegedly touted EthereumMax at a major bitcoin conference in Miami, and is said to have done so without disclosing that he was being compensated for his statements about the token. The lawsuit claims that the named plaintiff, a New York resident, and other investors who purchased EthereumMax tokens between May 14, 2021, and June 17, 2021, suffered losses as a result of the celebrities’ conduct. EthereumMax has lost around 97% of its value since early June, leading to allegations that it is a “scam,” and/or a “pump and dump” scheme. EthereumMax “has no connection” to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, the lawsuit states. The suit indicates that the company’s name may be an effort to mislead investors into believing incorrectly that the token is part of the Ethereum network. Whatever the merits of these and other recent legal actions prove to be, there can be little question that crypto companies – and their promoters – do not simply need to be attuned to anticipated new regulatory edicts and scrutiny. They must also be wary of lawsuits alleging misrepresentations of value and overstatements of likely returns on investment. In that respect, the cryptocurrency “Wild West” is only getting wilder. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - A “decentralized autonomous organization” called CityDAO was hoping to turn 40 acres in Wyoming into a “cryptocurrency city” — but their plans have now been targeted by hackers who successfully got away with members’ funds. The incident is yet another reminder that cryptocurrency technologies may be relatively secure in and of themselves, but the software used by their communities — in this case Discord —remains to be as vulnerable to hackers as ever. “EMERGENCY NOTICE,” a Twitter update by the group poste on Monday reads. “A CityDAO Discord admin account has been hacked. THERE IS NO LAND DROP. DO NOT CONNECT YOUR WALLET. ” CityDAO claimed in November to have become the first DAO to officially own land. Advertisement Advertisement “This parcel is a proof of concept parcel — it’s not in the most convenient location nor does it have an abundance of natural resources,” the group tweeted at the time. “It does have a well for water, a flat area for building, and is 45 minutes from an airport. ” “Each parcel of land is an NFT that can be owned collectively by the DAO collectively or by individuals,” reads CityDAO’s website. The goal of the city is to “build the future of real estate ownership on chain with Solidity and Web3” — and of course “make dank memes. ” DAOs have skyrocketed in popularity in the past year or so, promising community members equally divided representation as a way to be a part of a larger project. For instance, ConstitutionDAO recently attempted to purchase an original copy of the United States Constitution with $40 million in crypto last year — before being outbid by a hedge fund billionaire. Advertisement Advertisement But the cracks are starting to show. Hackers saw an easy target in CityDAO and managed to gain access to an admin Discord account and make a fake “land drop” from the compromised account. The infiltrator — or infiltrators — reportedly got away with $95,000 worth of Ethereum. One CityDAO victim tweeted on Tuesday that the attack was “a ridiculous security breach from Discord” that allowed the hacker to “bypass two-factor authentication and password. ” “I ask everyone to please be extremely careful when clicking on links in servers, connecting your wallets to applications and just activities online in general,” they added in a follow-up tweet. “We are trying our best to resolve the issue in the best outcome possible so please bare with us. ” The incident likely won’t be the last. Less than a month ago, different scammers pulled off a similar hack, CoinDesk points out, getting away with around $150,000 in crypto. Advertisement Advertisement Those interested to get into the DAO space should watch their backs, in other words. With all the attention they’ve been getting, hackers are starting to circle like sharks.

    "title": "Cryptocurrency roundup: bitcoin continues to slide as Lords say no need for a digital pound",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - Bitcoin continued its slide this week and fell below $40,000 for the first time since September 2021, as many digital currencies fell amid the “risk-off” sentiment sparked by a more hawkish Federal Reserve. The week was full of developments for the sector; the House of Lords suggested that Britain doesn’t need a central bank digital currency to American television Kim Kardashian facing a lawsuit for an alleged crypto “pump and dump” case. Here are the top stories that caught our eye. The House of Lords says Britain doesn’t need a digital pound The House of Lords – the second chamber of the UK parliament – said this week that there is no merit in the Bank of England’s efforts to develop a digital pound as it believes that concerns for financial stability and protection of privacy outweigh potential benefits that could come with a digital sterling. Alarmed by the growth in digital currencies in 2021, the Bank of England is one of many central banks across the world, including the European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China, that are exploring the possibility of launching a central digital bank currency (CBDC). CBDCs are a digital form of a country’s fiat currency. Unlike traditional money, it is not in physical form. But the Lords’ report has complicated Britain’s CBDC ambitions. Michael Forsyth, who sits in the Lords as Lord Forsyth of Drumlean and is chair of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, said the “the introduction of a UK central bank digital currency would have far-reaching consequences for households, businesses, and the monetary system”. There are two main security risks posed by a CBDC, say the Lords. The first is the risk that individual accounts could be compromised by taking advantage of weaknesses in cybersecurity, and there is the threat of the centralised ledger being hacked by hostile state and non-state actors. The report also suggested that CBDCs would infringe peoples’ privacy as it would give the state greater surveillance over peoples’ financial decisions. However, the committee was not all downbeat on the digital pound. It said that the case for a digital pound could change in the future and proposed the government and Bank of England take action to “shape global standards which suit the UK’s values and interests, for example with regard to privacy, security and operational standards”. China plans to deploy infrastructure to support NFTs China may have banned cryptocurrencies last year, but that hasn’t stopped it from steering clear of non-fungible-tokens (NFTs). China’s state-backed Blockchain Services Network (BSN) is planning to launch infrastructure at the end of the month that will support non-fungible tokens, reports the South China Morning Post. He Yifan, chief executive of technical support company Red Date Technology, the company behind the NFT infrastructure launch, told the paper that the NFT market will not encounter any legal issues so long as the sector distances itself from cryptocurrencies.

    "title": "Do cryptocurrency prices affect the value of NFTs? Let us find out",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - The non-fungible token (NFT), a relatively unknown concept until recently, has now become ubiquitous. Spending on the digital asset jumped to nearly $41 billion at the end of 2021–from just $1 billion in 2020–per a report by blockchain specialist Chainalysis. NFTs transform art, music, and even sports, and provide creators the option to monetise their digital artwork. Last year, the NFT market saw sales at eye-popping levels. A digital photo collage by South Carolina-based graphic designer Mike Winkelmann, known to the art world as ‘Beeple’, for example, sold for $69. 3 million, making it one of the biggest NFT sales to date. The value of NFTs depends on various factors–their scarcity, the demand for the artwork or sometimes even the artist, and the prices of the underlying cryptocurrency used. Many online marketplaces that sell NFTs are powered by a blockchain. Currently, the ethereum blockchain powers the most popular ones. So, if you are looking to buy or sell NFTs through one of the popular marketplaces, you will most likely need ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether, for the transaction. Also read: But what is interesting is that while cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, not all NFTs track the movement of their underlying crypto. For instance, despite the ongoing correction in crypto markets, NFT marketplace OpenSea has recorded $2. 3 billion in volume in January so far, on pace to break its monthly volume record if the trend continues. Discussing last weekend’s crypto selloff with Yahoo! Finance, Mason Nystrom, senior research analyst at crypto analytics firm Messari explained this anomaly. Despite the volatility of the crypto market, the nature of NFTs may make them independent from the crypto markets, Nystrom said. “NFTs are a significantly broad category that can include music, art, collectibles, gaming assets, fantasy sports, financial assets, and more. As such, it’s possible that NFT commerce in one specific vertical grows while others decline or fluctuate over time,” he added. “Going forward it’s possible that we’ll see a greater decoupling of the crypto markets whereby one asset like art NFTs might perform well amidst the overall crypto market performing poorly or vice versa. ” A collector who goes by the pseudonym ‘Pranksy’ had another theory. “The people who spent many thousands on NFTs aren’t going to sell them for 50% off tomorrow, at least not many are. Much like traditional art markets bucking Wall Street trends, I believe many see certain NFTs as a store of value,” he told Reuters in May last year after his cryptocurrency portfolio’s worth dropped by more than $10 million at some point on one day. Collectors believe artwork, virtual land and other digital assets represented by NFTs hold value that is distinct from the cryptocurrencies used to buy them. A study by sciencedirect. com titled ‘Is non-fungible token pricing driven by cryptocurrencies?’ suggests there is a low spillover between cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The study used the dataset of the two largest cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin and Ether, with the raw data obtained from coinmarketcap. com and the NFT data taken from secondary markets trades: Decentraland LAND tokens, CryptoPunk images, and Axie Infinity game characters, and Individual trade data sourced from nonfungible. com. The results from the study show that when it comes to volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the spillover effect to NFT markets is lower, suggesting the NFT and the cryptocurrency market are distinct from each other and do not necessarily affect each other in a meaningful way. NonFungible. com co-founder Gauthier Zuppinger told Reuters in May that the NFT market was increasingly de-correlated with the crypto market. Crypto-rich investors could even see NFTs as less risky than cryptocurrencies “because they are backed by the use-case,” Zuppinger pointed out. "

The sudden hike in prices of the popular ‘meme coin’ came after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that customers can now purchase merchandise from the electric car manufacturer using Dogecoin (DOGE). “Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin,” Musk said in tweeted on Friday. The announcement brought much joy to Dogecoin fans. Currently, Tesla sells products such as the “Cyberwhistle” and “Cyberquad for Kids”. These products can now be bought using cryptocurrency, according to the Tesla website. However, Musk had made the initial announcement about Tesla accepting dogecoin as payment for merchandise in December. At that time, he had said that the electric carmaker will accept dogecoin as payment for merchandise on a test basis. Previously, the Tesla chief had also announced that the carmaker would accept Bitcoin, the most popular and widely accepted cryptocurrency, as a payment mode to purchase electric cars. The news led to a pump in the prices of the popular coin. Also Read: Recovered from Covid?

    "body": "2022/01/15 - As talks of banning crypto in India looms, a cryptocurrency index that compares the performance of significant cryptos has been launched. The digital currency index tracks the performance of the top 15 digital coins, including BTC, ETH and ADA. The Crypto Index TickerPlant is a global crypto software firm with a specialized sector of CryptoWire. On Monday, it announced the launch of India’s first index of cryptocurrencies, named IC15. IC15 is a rule-based broad market index that tracks and measures the performance of the top 15 most liquid cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The tracking covers the sum of the market capitalizations of all listed cryptocurrencies on major markets worldwide. Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity and appeal over several years, establishing themselves as an asset class. This index represents about 80% of market activity and is thus a key market tracking and monitoring tool. The Index Governance Committee at CryptoWire comprises domain experts, industry practitioners, and academicians. It will maintain, monitor, and administer the index while rebalancing it every three months. The index’s start date is April 1, 2018, and the base value is $10,000. Its price is in US dollars. The basket of 15 cryptocurrencies included in the index consists of Bitcoin BTC, Binance Coin BNB, Cardano ADA, Solana, Shiba Inu SHIB, and Dogecoin DOGE, among others. However, the index does not include stable coins such as Tether USDT and USDC. Bitcoin accounts for the most weight in the index, with a share of 51. 57%. Ethereum and Binance Coin have shares of 25. 79 percent and 5. 03 percent, respectively. The remaining cryptocurrencies have weights less than 5% each in the index. The Importance of the Crypto Index The launch of the index is significant since India has one of the world’s largest populations of cryptocurrency investors. However, according to media reports, all private cryptocurrencies could be banned in India. A bill proposing a ban on all private cryptocurrencies sits in Cabinet, awaiting approval. Meanwhile, India’s central bank is developing a centralized national digital currency. “We intend to complete the knowledge circle for the whole crypto and blockchain ecosystem with the opening of India’s first index of cryptocurrency IC15,” said Jigish Sonagara, CEO of CryptoWire. Additionally, the index’s rise may assist Indian crypto investors in making well-informed decisions. Tron is among the cryptocurrencies tracked by the new crypto Index. The price of TRON has dropped by 3. 06% in the previous seven days. In the last 24 hours, the price decreased by 0. 33%. As of this writing, the current live TRON price is $0. 077148 per unit, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 1,274,763,861. Tron is presently ranked number 28 on CoinMarketCap, with a current market cap of USD 7,857,680,366. It has a circulating supply of 101,851,519,439 TRX coins which is its maximum coin supply. "

    "title": "Cryptocurrency ads reach record levels on London transport",
    "body": "2022/01/15 - Cryptocurrency firms bombarded Londoners with a record number of adverts on public transport during 2021, fuelling calls for a ban to prevent people being lured into risky investments. The surge in adverts for crypto assets, which are unregulated in the UK, has prompted concerns about the risk of addiction and financial harm, particularly given the wild volatility in the price of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which reached record highs last year before crashing again. It also emerged that Transport for London (TfL) has not implemented a ban on gambling adverts promised by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, allowing the industry to step up its marketing activity in the meantime. Records obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show that TfL services displayed 39,560 crypto adverts from 13 firms in the six months between April and September 2021. Major advertisers include the trading platform eToro, floki – “a “meme coin” named after Elon Musk’s dog – Crypto. com and Luno Money, whose campaign telling people it was “time to buy” bitcoin was banned by the advertising regulator for being “irresponsible”. The promotional drive eclipsed previous years, as advertisers tapped into the popularity of smartphone trading apps and increased awareness of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether. In 2019, the only advertiser offering crypto services on TfL buses and trains was trading platform eToro, which paid for just five digital displays and 40 “supersides”, long posters on the side of doubledecker buses. Despite widespread working from home in 2020, the volume of crypto ads increased, with companies including Luno Money and Coinfloor buying 1,595 ads between them. Before the recent surge, 2018 was the busiest year for crypto ads on TfL since it started recording data in 2017. Even then, 15,000 were shown in 12 months, compared with 39,560 after just six months of 2021, including promotions for relatively obscure firms such as Hex, Kraken, BOTS, and Puglife. In total, crypto companies have spent £825,245 to advertise on TfL tube and train services since 2018. The organisation does not hold spending data for buses. A separate freedom of information request by the Guardian revealed that the crypto advertising push was mirrored by a significant increase in gambling ads, as Khan’s April 2021 promise to ban gambling ads appeared to stall. In 2018-19, online casinos and bookmakers spent £783,476 to advertise on TfL services, then £1m the following year, followed by £1. 16m in 2020-21. But they spent £1. 17m in the first three months of the 2021-22 period. While the Euros football championship likely to have fuelled the increase in part, spending was nearly six times higher than in 2018, the year of the last World Cup. Khan pledged to ban gambling ads in his manifesto, published nearly nine months ago, but a spokesperson for the Mayor’s office said it was yet to be enacted. Siân Berry, the Green party’s former co-leader, now its London Assembly member, urged Khan to move forward with the ban and extend it to crypto adverts. “Investment bubbles have always worked by dragging in more and more inexperienced suckers towards the end of the cycle. That’s the stage at which some of these projects may be at with all this public advertising,” she said. “The risk is that they draw in people who are more likely than not to lose money, which is closely equivalent to gambling and I think these promotions should be banned by Transport for London in the same way. ” “People are struggling at the moment and they may have had blows to their life chances. They may have lost livelihoods or homes and be susceptible to get-rich-quick schemes. ” “Are TfL doing proper checks to establish whether these are legitimate companies?” A TfL spokesperson said all adverts contained a disclaimer stating that crypto is unregulated in the UK and that the value of investments could fall. The transport body is vetting ads before they run and is understood to be refusing any that use similar language to those that have been banned or investigated by the ASA. It has written to both the FCA and ASA seeking further guidance. The managing director of eToro UK, Dan Moczulski, said: “eToro fully supports measures, including regulation, designed to protect and educate investors about crypto and other financial asset classes. ” Asked about the concerns raised about their advertising, several of the crypto firms responded, saying any dangers were well flagged and not unique to crypto assets. Floki, one of whose adverts is being investigated by the ASA, said banning crypto ads would be “censorship” and that ads should be regulated and include disclaimers. It also said crypto was “anything but a bubble” and would “change the world as we know it”. Kraken said bubbles “generally don’t last over a decade” with a high degree of adoption by institutions. BOTS said all investments came with risk and pointed out that the financial crisis of 2008 showed traditional finance wasn’t without dangers. Luno Money, whose bitcoin advert was banned by the ASA last year, said it would welcome “more formal guidance”, which it hoped would emerge this year. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - Given the roaring adoption of cryptocurrency—it’s no surprise that more cyber criminals are using cryptocurrency. With more countries learning to take advantage of the uncensored transparency that blockchain offers, the criminal usage of cryptocurrencies will drop around the world, claims a new report by data analytics firm Chainalysis. Blockchain is an underlying technology consisting an open ledger that contains all the transactions ever made, albeit in an anonymous and encrypted form. Bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies are essentially codes recorded on a blockchain that gets longer and longer as more people use them. Across all cryptocurrencies tracked by data analytics firm Chainalysis, total transaction volume in cryptocurrency grew to $15. 8 trillion in 2021, up 567 per cent from 2020. The report claims that the growth of legitimate cryptocurrency usage will outpace the growth of criminal usage.       In Premium   Explained: Digital currencies and how they work   According to the report, “transactions involving illicit addresses represented just 0. 15 percent of cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021. ” This means that legitimate transactions has already surpassed illicit transactions and the trend will continue in 2022 as well. Additionally, Chainalysis in its recent report revealed that scammers stole over $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency from victims in 2021 —up by 79 per cent from $7. 8 billion in 2020. As of early 2022, Chainalysis said illicit address already hold over $10 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, with the majority of this held by wallets associated with cryptocurrency theft. It should be noted that the rise in decentralized finance (DeFi) which facilitates crypto-denominated lending outside traditional banking, has been a big factor in the increase in stolen funds and scams. In another report in December, Chainalysis revealed that at least 36 per cent of the victims lost over $2. 8 billion (Rs 280 crores approx. ) to ‘rug pull’ cases. A rug pull is a malicious maneuver in the cryptocurrency industry where crypto developers abandon a project and run away with investors’ funds. In total, crypto scams rose by 81 percent this year from 2020 led by rug pulls, the company said in a blog post. Meanwhile, US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had issued a warning in November, against cybercriminals that are using Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes to defraud unsuspecting individuals. "

    "body": "2022/01/15 - How Are Cryptocurrencies Made? If you want to create a cryptocurrency, then you have a few different options. From most to least difficult, you can: Create your own blockchain and native cryptocurrency. Modify the code of an existing blockchain. Establish a new cryptocurrency on an existing blockchain. Hire a blockchain developer to create a cryptocurrency for you. The majority of these options require at least some technical computer knowledge, in addition to financial and human resources. The most technical alternatives afford the highest degree of customization, which for some cryptocurrency developers is worth the expense. Keep reading to dig into each possible way to make a cryptocurrency. Key Takeaways Anyone can create a cryptocurrency, but the process requires the commitment of time, money, and other resources, in addition to advanced technical knowledge. The main options are creating your own blockchain, modifying an existing blockchain, establishing a coin on an existing blockchain, or hiring a blockchain developer. Making a cryptocurrency is the easy part—maintaining and growing it over time is usually more challenging. Option 1: Create your own blockchain and native cryptocurrency You can write your own code to create a new blockchain that supports a native cryptocurrency. Pursuing this option usually requires extensive technical training to develop coding skills and a fundamental understanding of blockchain technology—but it also affords the greatest amount of design freedom. If you want to create a cryptocurrency that is truly new or innovative in some way, then building your own blockchain to support that coin is probably your best option. You can design your native coin in any way that you like. Native coins, which by definition have their own blockchains, are considered as superior to tokens, which are digital currencies that operate on other blockchain networks. If you decide that building a new blockchain is your next step, then here’s what you need to do: Choose a consensus mechanism. A blockchain’s operating protocol is also known as its consensus mechanism. The most commonly used consensus mechanisms are proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS). A blockchain’s operating protocol is also known as its consensus mechanism. The most commonly used consensus mechanisms are proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS). Design your blockchain architecture. Should your blockchain be private or public? Permissioned or permissionless? You get to decide, and it all depends on your reasons for making a cryptocurrency. Should your blockchain be private or public? Permissioned or permissionless? You get to decide, and it all depends on your reasons for making a cryptocurrency. Audit your new blockchain and its code. Many cryptocurrency developers choose to hire specialized blockchain auditors to review their blockchain’s code and identify any vulnerabilities. Many cryptocurrency developers choose to hire specialized blockchain auditors to review their blockchain’s code and identify any vulnerabilities. Verify legal compliance. It’s a good idea to pay for expert legal advice before you mint any new cryptocurrency. Legal professionals can confirm that your cryptocurrency is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. And then, finally, you are ready to mint your new cryptocurrency. How many coins you decide to issue initially is completely up to you. You can decide to mint the complete supply of coins in a single batch, or gradually increase the coin supply over time as new blocks are added to the blockchain. Option 2: Modify the code of an existing blockchain You can decide to use the source code of another blockchain to create a new blockchain and native cryptocurrency. Pursuing this option still likely requires technical knowledge, as you may choose to modify the source code to satisfy your design objectives. The code for most blockchains is open source, meaning that anyone can view and download it. You can find the source codes of most blockchains on the GitHub platform. After you download and modify the source code of an existing blockchain, you still need to work with a blockchain auditor and obtain professional legal advice. After that, you are ready to mint your new cryptocurrency. Option 3: Establish a new cryptocurrency on an existing blockchain You can make a new cryptocurrency without first creating or modifying any blockchain. Platforms like the Ethereum blockchain are designed to host the cryptocurrencies of many different developers. The resulting new currency would be classified as a token, which is any digital money that is not native to the blockchain on which it operates. Creating a token that uses an existing blockchain can require some technical expertise, but anyone with moderate computer knowledge can probably create their own token without too much difficulty. Let’s run through the basic steps to create a new token on an existing blockchain platform: Choose the blockchain platform: Your first step is to decide which blockchain should host your token. You have many options, with the Ethereum platform and Binance Smart Chain being among the most popular. Create the token: The process required to create your token varies based on how much you wish to customize the token. Creating a highly customized token generally requires advanced technical knowledge, but free online tools such as WalletBuilders can also facilitate the token creation process in just a few clicks. Mint your new cryptocurrency: After creating the cryptocurrency, you are ready to mint the new tokens. Using a trusted platform like Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum means that you may not need the services of a professional auditor or lawyer before issuing a batch of tokens. Tokens are generally less customized than coins, but making a token is usually the fastest and cheapest way to make a cryptocurrency. Your token can benefit from the security provisions of an established blockchain platform, and the blockchain platform may offer other innovative features for token creators. Being associated with a well-established blockchain platform can help to enhance your token’s value and credibility. Option 4: Hire a blockchain developer to create a cryptocurrency for you You can create a new coin or token with any degree of customization by hiring a blockchain development company. Many enterprises, known as blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) companies, exist to create and maintain new blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies. Some BaaS companies develop customized blockchains, while others use their own existing blockchain infrastructure. You can also work with a BaaS company to launch a highly customized token on an existing blockchain platform. Some of the most prominent BaaS companies include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, ChainZilla, and Blockstream. Pros and Cons of Making a Cryptocurrency Pros Can customize the cryptocurrency in any way Opportunity to learn more about blockchain technology Potential for the cryptocurrency to gain value Cons Generally requires technical knowledge Can be time consuming and costly Requires ongoing maintenance for the cryptocurrency to be successful What to Know Before Making a Cryptocurrency Anyone can create a cryptocurrency, even just for fun. But launching a cryptocurrency that is successful and gains value generally requires the commitment of time, money, and other resources, in addition to advanced technical knowledge. Making a cryptocurrency is the easy part—maintaining and growing it over time is usually much more challenging. If you are simply curious about crypto, then there’s likely no harm in creating your own token. Just make sure to avoid any activities that might be considered as an initial coin offering (ICO) by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as you don’t want to accidentally violate any U. S. securities laws. With so many coins and tokens being released, you won’t be the only person or organization experimenting with making your own cryptocurrency. Can I make my own cryptocurrency? You can make your own cryptocurrency. Usually creating a new coin or token requires some computer coding expertise, but you also can choose to hire a blockchain developer to create a digital currency for you. Launching a token on an existing blockchain platform like Ethereum can be accomplished with relatively little technical expertise. How much does it cost to make a cryptocurrency? The cost of creating a cryptocurrency varies widely based on how much you choose to customize the coin or token. Highly customized coins established on native blockchains are the most expensive to create, while launching a standardized token on the Ethereum platform can be free through apps like WalletBuilders.

    "title": "Bharti Airtel attacks Jio’s indigenous-developed 5G network, calls for embracing global standards",
    "body": "2020/12/09 - Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology. The idea to develop India specific 5G standard is an existential threat and will lock the country out of the global ecosystem, a senior Bharti Airtel official said on Tuesday. The official also said the development of a separate 5G standard will impact innovation. “There are sometimes talks that India must have its own 5G standard. This is an existential threat which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation. We could have let our citizens down if you allow that to happen,” Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said while speaking at virtual India Mobile Congress 2020. The statement from Vittal followed a speech by RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani at the event, where he mentioned that Jio’s 5G network “will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components”. Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology. The company’s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies. Vittal said India should have an open ecosystem. He cited examples of CDMA and GSM to push his case. “CDMA was better technology, but GSM won because it was more accepted technology. More companies in the world embraced GSM. GSM won because it became part of the global ecosystem and CDMA died,” he added. He said that there is a need to create an India open ecosystem and promote applications developed for India and by India. “For this we have to come together. We have to set aside our differences and be part of one. Telcos, equipment players, device players, manufacturing companies, IT companies. Everyone can benefit as the globe of technology makes it all more productive,” Vittal said. He called for enabling a policy environment that keeps access to affordable technology. “…If we as a country can embrace global standards, create an open ecosystem for India and leverage this to reimagine our businesses by having a single and predictable policy environment, the entrepreneurial energy of India will develop digital India,” Vittal said. He had earlier said that the company will refrain from bidding for 5G spectrum if the reserve price is high. Regulator Trai has recommended a price of Rs 492 crore per Mhz for spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band which is considered suitable for 5G services at present. Telecom operators interested in buying radiowaves for 5G services will have to shell out a minimum of Rs 9,840 crore on pan-India basis to buy spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band as Trai has suggested that it should be put to auction in the block size of 20 MHz. Earlier also, Airtel had said that it will not bid for this spectrum at the Trai-recommended price as companies will need to shell out about Rs 50,000 crore to acquire a decent quantity of frequencies in this band.

    "body": "2020/12/09 - Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder of Bharti Airtel recently addressed the nation in the Indian Mobile Congress (IMC) and said that India would be 5G ready in the next two to three years. This is because at the moment, in the Indian landscape, pricing of the spectrum and the equipment of 5G is too high and unfeasible for the industry. But he said that the pricing of the equipment would soon come down and it would help India become a 5G nation in the next two to three years — More details on the story ahead. Mittal Says India to be 5G Read in Next 2 to 3 Years Sunil Mittal, in his speech, said that India is well-positioned to benefit on the 5G front with all the global investments it has got in the past few months. But for this to happen, the prices of the equipment need to lower. Adding to this, he further expressed that the availability of the devices will also place a major role in the rollout of 5G in India. A very short percentage of Indian consumers hold a 5G compatible device at the moment. This number needs to increase so that a successful 5G rollout can be ensured in India. Mittal further said that India is well-posed in the space communications industry as well. He termed the space as the ‘next frontier of communication’. Mittal expressed that India with all of its advancements in technology in the space industry and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will ensure that advantages move in India’s favour when it comes to the space communication. The global pandemic has forced India towards the digitising the economy, said Mittal. He believes that within 2 to 3 years, 5G would become the standard norm in the mobile broadband space of India. “India has moved from a landline-centric nation to a digitally-enabled mobile broadband centric company”, said Mittal in his speech at the IMC, 2020. He also expressed a lot of excitement about Bharti Airtel stepping into the space communications industry. "

    "body": "2020/12/09 - NEW DELHI: With the chances of a Covid-19 vaccine being available soon increasing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the mobile technology will be used for mass inoculation against the pandemic. Speaking at the India Mobile Congress, he said mobile technology has enabled benefits worth billions of dollars to reach the deserving and also helped the poor and vulnerable during the pandemic. ”It is also with the help of mobile technology that we will embark on one of the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive,” he said. He did not provide details. Three leading coronavirus vaccine developers – Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc and Bharat Biotech – have applied for emergency use authorization in India. While Pfizer India has applied to drug regulator for permission to import its experimental mRNA vaccine for sale and distribution without the requirement for local clinical trials , Serum Institute of India Ltd, AstraZeneca’s India vaccine partner, has applied for emergency use authorisation using data from Phase-III trials that were conducted locally, as well as in Brazil and the UK. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has sought nod Covaxin which is being indigenously developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The applications mean that a mass vaccine effort could be shortly underway in a nation that has the world’s second-largest coronavirus caseload. At the IMC, Modi said, “We need to work together to ensure a timely roll-out of 5G to leapfrog into the future and empower millions of Indians. ”He also pitched for making India a global hub for telecom equipment, design, development and manufacturing. Speaking on mobile technology, he said it was because of this that the government was able to provide benefits worth billions of dollars to millions of Indians. ”It is because of mobile technology that we are seeing billions of cashless transactions which boost formalisation and transparency. It is because of mobile technology that we will enable smooth contactless interface on toll booths,” he said. "

The bank was granted permission to raise the Rs 7,000 crore through QIP this financial year. PNB Managing Director SS Mallikarjuna Rao had announced earlier that it had taken the board’s approval to raise Rs 14,000 crore by way of Additional Tier 1 (AT-1) bonds, Tier II, and QIP. He had said: “Of this, Rs 4,000 crore is for Tier II. Against this, we have raised Rs 2,500 crore and remaining Rs 1,500 crore and additional Rs 3,000 crore from AT-1 bonds will be raised before November 30. With respect to QIP of Rs 7,000 crore, we are planning to go to the market in the second or third week of December.

    "title": "COVID 19 survivors with long term symptoms need urgent attention experts say",
    "body": "2020/12/06 - There is an urgent need to address long-term symptoms of the coronavirus, leading U. S. public health officials said this week, warning that hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of people worldwide might experience lingering problems that could impede their ability to work and function normally. In a two-day meeting Thursday and Friday, the federal government’s first workshop dedicated to long-term COVID-19, public health officials, medical researchers and patients said the condition needed to be recognized as a syndrome, given a name and taken seriously by doctors. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said at the conference Thursday. While the number of people affected is still unknown, he said, if long-term symptoms afflict even a small proportion of the millions of people infected with the coronavirus, it is “going to represent a significant public health issue. ” Such symptoms — ranging from breathing trouble to heart issues to cognitive and psychological problems — are already plaguing an untold number of people worldwide. Even for people who were never sick enough to be hospitalized, the aftermath can be long and grueling, with a complex and lasting mix of symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently posted a list of some long-term symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, chest pain, brain fog and depression, but doctors and researchers said they still know little about the extent or cause of many of the problems, which patients will develop them or how to address them. Over the past several months, coronavirus patients with lingering, debilitating health issues have been widely referred to as “COVID long-haulers. ” But some survivors and experts feel that name trivializes the experience, lessening its importance as a medical syndrome that doctors and insurers should recognize, diagnose and try to treat. One of the pressing issues that patients and experts are now weighing is what official medical term should be adopted to describe the collection of post-COVID symptoms. “We need to dig in and do the work that needs to be done to help relieve the suffering and stop this madness,” said Dr. Michael Saag, an infectious disease expert from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who was a co-chair of a session. In an inadvertent but stark illustration of the difficulty of the recovery process, two of the four patients scheduled to speak at the meeting were unable to because they had recently been rehospitalized. “Those individuals had their acute illness several months ago, and they’ve been suffering pretty mightily since then,” Saag said. “And the fact that they’re still struggling with this gives extra power to what we’re trying to do today. ” Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer of the CDC’s COVID response and the co-chair with Saag of one session, said he expected long-term post-COVID symptoms would affect “on the order of tens of thousands in the United States and possibly hundreds of thousands. ”       A patient is wheeled into a hospital during the coronavirus pandemic in the Manhattan borough of New York City on Friday.    REUTERS   He added, “If you were to ask me, what do we know about this post-acute phase, I really am hard-pressed to tell you that we know much. This is what we’re really working on epidemiologically: to understand what is it, how many people get it, how long does it last, what causes it, who does it affect — and then, of course, what can we do to prevent it from happening?” Presentations from COVID-19 survivors — including Dr. Peter Piot, a world-renowned infectious disease expert who helped discover the Ebola virus — made it clear that for many people, recovering from the disease is not like flipping a switch. Piot, who is director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a special adviser on COVID-19 research to the president of the European Commission, said he contracted the coronavirus in March and was hospitalized for a week in April. The acute phase of his illness involved some but not all of the classic disease symptoms. For example, his oxygen saturation was very low, but he did not develop shortness of breath or a cough until after he got home from the hospital. For the next month, he experienced a rapid heart rate several hours a day, he said. For nearly four months, he experienced extreme fatigue and insomnia. “What I found most frustrating personally was that I couldn’t do anything,” said Piot, who now considers himself recovered except for needing more sleep than before his infection. “I just had to wait for improvement. ” Chimére Smith, 38, a teacher in Baltimore who has not been able to work since becoming sick in March, said she had struggled for months to have her symptoms, which included loss of vision in one eye, taken seriously by doctors. “It’s been a harrowing task, and the task and the journey continues,” she said. Smith, who is Black, said it was especially important to inform people in underserved communities that long-term effects are “as real and possible as dying from the virus itself. ” The condition, she said, “not only needs to be explored, but it needs to be explained to the same group of people who suffer with being stricken with it the most, and that’s the minority population. I am not just here today for me; I am here for us. ” Hannah Davis, 32, a researcher and artist in Brooklyn, New York, described neurological and cognitive symptoms that began in late March. “I forgot my partner’s name,” she said. “I forgot about sleep. I would regularly pick up a hot pan, burn myself, put it down, and literally do it again. I forgot how to shower. I forgot how to dress myself. ” Months later, some things have improved, but she still struggles to remember things, saying, “I feel like I am basically on a 48-hour memory cycle. ” Davis is part of a long-term COVID survivor group called Body Politic and said a survey of 3,800 of its members in 56 countries has found that 85% report cognitive dysfunction, 81% had numbness and other neurological sensations, nearly half had speech and language issues, and nearly three-quarters had some difficulty working at their jobs. Clinics treating COVID survivors are seeing a striking number of people with brain fog and other thinking problems as well as psychological issues, doctors participating in the workshop said. “Approximately three months after their acute illness, more than half of our patients have at least a mild cognitive impairment,” said Dr. Ann Parker, who codirects a post-COVID clinic at Johns Hopkins. “We’re also seeing substantial mental health impairments. ” Dr. Janet Diaz, head of clinical care for the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 response, said the agency is planning a meeting focused on long-term coronavirus effects and will soon start collecting data on post-COVID symptoms and medical visits. She said that while doctors are accustomed to prolonged recovery challenges for people hospitalized for serious illnesses, the lingering symptoms in younger people and those who were not hospitalized for the coronavirus “urgently needs to be better understood and investigated. ” © 2020 The New York Times Company Read more at nytimes. com PHOTO GALLERY (CLICK TO ENLARGE) "

    "body": "2020/11/30 - Goldwing sits on top of the line in Honda’s BigWing offerings in India Whenever one thinks of a big and brawny bike, Honda Goldwing will surely be one of the first to pop up in one’s head. The bike is huge and has a road presence no less than an SUV. Being a premium bike of a reputed global brand, the motorcycle comes with tons of gizmos on offer. However, the bike misses out on one feature which is still very novel in two-wheelers- adaptive cruise control. Recent introductions of radar-based tech on the brand new Ducati Multistrada V4 and BMW R1250RT have made Honda rethink and the company is now contemplating on adding this technology to its flagship offering. Patent images of Goldwing suggest that Honda is working on incorporating a radar-assisted sensor technology on its premium cruiser. This radar-based sensor will most likely be used to offer features such as adaptive cruise control and other safety and convenience systems. While radar-assisted cruise control is a familiar feature in premium cars, it is still a very nascent technology in motorcycles. Where could the sensors be mounted? Recent images are proof that Honda idly patenting technology which it isn’t going to use. However, the images do suggest the challenges for the Japanese brand as far as placing the radar on the bike. Going by the images, the radar sensor could be located in the middle of Goldwing’s massive headlamps. It needs to be kept in mind that radar sensors can see through some materials like plastic, however, the surface needs to be flat and smooth so that it doesn’t intervene with the radar waves. Fortunately for Honda, the space between Goldwing’s headlights is fairly uncluttered and flat and it intends to place the radar just behind the panel. This would make it invisible in plain sight thus not compromising on the bike’s looks. Honda also plans to bridge the gap between the radar sensor and bodywork by using a sponge-type material in order to prevent vibrations from fairing to reach the radar sensor and affecting its efficacy. The technology used in radar sensors in Ducati Multistrada V4 and upcoming BMW Motorrad bikes has been jointly developed by the respective manufacturers and German brand Bosch. Similar systems are also developed by Kawasaki and KTM in association with Bosch and are expected to be introduced in future. In all probability, Honda would too source its technology from Bosch. Honda also deals with the German electronic giant which supplies radar sensors for some of its cars to the Japanese automaker. When can we expect it? The latest iteration of Multistrada V4 also comes with a rear radar system that offers safety features such as Blind Spot Monitoring. Although, the patent images of Goldwing do not indicate a similar feature onboard. As of now, there has been no official word from Honda regarding this technology and when will it actually be available on the cruiser. However, if the company uses a radar sensor technology sourced from Bosch which would not require additional development, we might see this feature in production-spec models by 2022. SOURCE "

    "body": "2020/11/30 - Paytm Money, the wealth management arm of digital payments major Paytm, is set to open up IPO investments for its users, the company said in a press note on Monday. This is part of the Alibaba- and Softbank-backed Paytm’s overall aim to expand its financial services bouquet and match larger tech brokers such as Upstox, Zerodha and 5Paisa in terms of offerings. “In the near future, we plan to launch IPO funding, derivatives trading, margin finance and a host of other value-adding features to make investing seamless and convenient. This is aligned with our mission to drive financial inclusion across the country,” said Varun Sridhar, Chief Executive Officer, Paytm Money. Paytm needs its ancillary business bets to work out since its core payments business continues to be a low-margin and mostly zero revenue game. While on the one hand it is offering banking, on the other it is offering loans and credit cards hoping to recover losses incurred in the core payments business. Paytm Money has also been losing money. As of 2019, the company spent Rs 37 crore to generate a turnover of Rs 76 lakh. Its 2020 filings have not been made public yet. Eyeing better prospects Broking can be an extremely profitable business and these back to back product launches are expected to help Paytm on that path. Paytm Money opened stockbroking for all participants through the app in September. In October the company added ETFs or exchange traded funds. Now, it has opened up IPO participation for its users as well. Initial Public Offerings or IPOs are the first set of shares offered by companies that get listed on bourses. Paytm is hoping to bring in more retail traders to participate in IPOs by making the application process simple and seamless through the Paytm Money app. Leveraging UPI The Bengaluru-based company said that it would allow traders to use their UPI IDs to apply for IPOs and link the transaction to their bank accounts. The entire process will be completed within three to four days, the company claimed. The platform offers an interface to make changes to, cancel or reapply for a bid within the IPO window. It is equipped with features such as enabling investors to track upcoming IPOs, view a company’s history, its details, download the prospectus, and also check the performance of past IPOs. This service is available on both the Paytm Money app and website. Unlike buying and selling of stocks, which is a pretty straightforward process, an IPO process involves allotment of a set number shares within a few days of the IPO window closing. In comparison with the days of the paper-driven process, UPI has made allotments digital and simple. Tech-enabled brokers such as Zerodha have leveraged the UPI-enabled process to get more retail traders to participate in the IPO process. Now, Paytm Money joins their ranks hoping to get tech-savvy traders and first-time market participants to place their IPO bids through the Paytm Money app. Paytm Money had been launched as a direct mutual funds platform and had Pravin Jadhav as its chief executive. However, Jadhav quit in early 2020 to make way for Sridhar. "

    "title": "Why lockdown can save the RBI from explaining failure to fight inflation to govt",
    "body": "2020/09/17 - Text Size: A- A+ Mumbai: It seems the Covid-19 lockdown may have allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to wriggle out of an embarrassing situation. The central bank is currently facing the grim prospect of answering to Parliament for failing to achieve its inflation target. According to the RBI Act, if average inflation stays out of the 2-6 per cent range for three consecutive quarters, then it is seen as a failure of the central bank. Average inflation was above 6 per cent in the March and June quarters, and also over 6 per cent in July and August. However, if minutes of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting after the August policy review are an indication, the central bank may have found a way of not writing an explanation letter to the government. The MPC is of the view that there was a break in the consumer price index (CPI) series since inflation data for April and May was imputed and not collected by visiting the markets by NSO surveyors. The surveyors could not make the field visits for data collection due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of novel coronavirus. “The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nation-wide lockdown. The NSO has, however, not provided inflation rates for April and May,” the MPC observed in the August meeting minutes. “For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, therefore, the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series. ” Put simply, the MPC has come to the conclusion that there is a break in the CPI series since there was no data collection in April and May, and the inflation figures for these two months was the estimation of NSO and not the actual numbers. Also read: RBI expected to make inflation and growth forecast on 1 October — first time this fiscal ‘Valid point, but explain’ Experts agree with the MPC that there is a break in the CPI series, but say the central bank should still write the letter to the lawmakers explaining the same. “The point that has been made by RBI that the series is broken is technically right,” said A. Prasanna, head of Research, ICICI Securities PD. “Since prices of many items were not available, the index was imputed in April and May. So that is a valid point. But my own view is, that itself can be mentioned in the letter. They can explain this in the letter and then give their outlook. RBI’s outlook is that inflation will come down in the second half without any policy action,” Prasanna told ThePrint. In its submission to the lawmakers for failing to achieve the inflation target, the central bank needs to answer three questions — why it has failed to achieve its target; what remedial measures it would take to bring inflation back within the target range; and by what time. In the minutes, RBI indicated remedial action to bring back inflation will be hiking interest rates. “…if inflation persists above the upper tolerance band for one more quarter, monetary policy will be constrained by mandate to undertake remedial action, including an immediate and more than proportionate response to head off the build-up of inflation pressures and prevent it from getting generalised. The question is: can the economy withstand it in this virus-ravaged, debilitated state?” RBI Deputy Governor Michael Patra said in the minutes. So, if CPI series is seen as broken, then interest rate hikes can be avoided. Also read: RBI’s first Monetary Policy Committee bows out, its record sullied by inflation at the end ‘Media and markets creating a big issue’ But why would there be a need for remedial measures as RBI’s own estimates suggest inflation will come down in the second half of the financial year? “We track September inflation at a lower 6. 5%, albeit still above the RBI’s 2-6% mandate. That said, we see CPI inflation slipping to 2. 5-3% in 2HFY21 on the back of base effects, good rains and low demand with FY21 GDP set to fall 7. 5%,” BofA Securities said in a note to its clients. It expects the RBI to cut interest rates by 15 basis points in the next policy review meeting scheduled on 1 October and a total 75 bps in the current financial year. In this financial year so far, the RBI has reduced the policy rates by 40 bps. “So I don’t agree with the point in RBI minutes that they will have to spell out remedial measures. RBI can say that without any monetary action inflation will subside below 6% by next year. So where is the need to take remedial measures,” Prasanna said. He said the media and markets have created a big issue out of writing a letter, which is a very mechanical and a procedural thing, in his view. “…it should not be called a failure if inflation exceeds target due to one off factors. This word failure has created a stigma. For example, the Bank of England also wrote those letters in 2010 when inflation rose above their target. Notably, they were doing quantitative easing at that time. But they wrote a letter explaining why inflation was high and why it will come down without any need for policy action,” he added.

    "title": "Why India doesn t print a ton of money to fight poverty",
    "body": "2020/09/17 - The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the world into a recession. Major global economies are responding to the COVID-19 induced recession by adopting unorthodox measures. The United States, the European Central Bank, Japan, and even emerging economies such as Turkey and Indonesia are printing money to bring economies back to life. However, India has refrained from doing so. After the Q1 financial year 2020-21 GDP deceleration of 23. 9%, the highest among major economies of the world, the chorus is growing in India for monetisation of the fiscal deficit: in layman’s language, printing more money to boost the ailing economy. Especially, because the repercussions of not spending to support the economy could be irreparable. But before that, let’s understand a few things: What is fiscal deficit? Fiscal deficit is the difference between the total revenue or income of the government less its expenditure. For FY 2019-20, the central government’s receipts through income taxes, GST and other receipts were Rs 19. 32 lakh crore, while its expenditure on schemes, subsidies, and infrastructure, interest payments were Rs 26. 98 lakh crore. Hence, the fiscal deficit was Rs 7. 66 lakh crore. It is expressed as a percentage of the GDP. The figure was 3. 8% in FY 2019-20. Take the case of an individual, if she spends more than she earns, how would she make up for the difference? Well, she would need to borrow, from friends or banks or moneylenders. Similarly, the government also borrows money from the market to finance the fiscal deficit. It usually issues bonds which are subscribed by individuals and institutional investors. They lend money to the government with the promise of future payment. These bonds carry a lower rate of interest than what is available to corporates/individuals, as they are considered as risk free. The central government has hiked the market borrowing for this year to Rs 12 lakh crore from Rs 7. 8 lakh crore presented in the Union Budget in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, implying fiscal deficit will shoot its target. Why do governments spend more than they earn? Politicians and policymakers rely on fiscal deficits to expand popular policies/schemes, such as welfare programmes and public works, without having to raise taxes or cut spending elsewhere in the Budget, to elicit support during elections. What is monetisation of fiscal deficit? Monetisation of fiscal deficit refers to the purchase of government bonds by the central bank, i. e. the Reserve Bank of India. Since the central bank creates fresh money by simply printing to buy these bonds, in layman’s language, monetisation of deficit means printing more money. This helps finance the spending needs of the government. The government spends this money on infrastructure projects which creates jobs, having a multiplier effect on the economy. This money could be used by the government to provide more funds for its welfare schemes, NREGA, transfers to Jan Dhan accounts, etcetera which then provide a fillip to consumption, which has been badly hit by the pandemic. Consumption, both private and government, accounts for about 70% of India’s GDP. That’s great. Why doesn’t India just print tonnes of money and distribute to the populace to ensure nobody is poor? It’s not easy. In the past when countries have tried to get richer by printing money it hasn’t worked. Printing more money increases money supply in the economy. Now everyone has more money, more money is chasing goods and services. This leads to an increase in prices as sellers take advantage of the situation and charge more. This has happened earlier in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. The countries suffered from hyperinflation, in simple terms very high inflation. In Zimbabwe prices rose as much as 231,000,000% in a single year in 2008. The paper used probably became worth more than the banknote denomination printed on it. Should the RBI then print money to revive the economy, especially when the stimulus package announced by the government is deemed insufficient? Economists are divided on the issue: while some have cautioned against the move, others say limited monetisation can be undertaken given the extraordinary situation. The money received by the government from the RBI can be used to fund higher spending and protect the economy, the poor and vulnerable in these abnormal times. Story continues "

    "title": "Oil Tanker Industry Is In An Ocean Of Trouble",
    "body": "2020/09/17 - There has been more than enough written about the woes of various segments of the oil industry and related industries so far this year. But there is one industry that actually thrived during the worst of the crisis: as the world drowned in oil amid slumping demand and excess supply, tanker owners enjoyed a bounce in freight rates as these vessels remained the only storage space for unsellable crude. But things have changed. OPEC+ oil production cuts helped bring down global inventories, including the massive amounts of oil in floating storage. This brought down freight rates from over $250,000 per day for a Very Large Crude Carrier to less than $30,000 per day, leaving tanker owners wondering how much longer they could survive. Right now, they have one hope, just like air travel: a successful vaccine. Oil demand is out the window thanks to the pandemic and there is no telling when—and even if—it will ever be coming back. Yet it is pretty easy to link a rebound in economic activity across the world with a rebound in oil demand. This rebound, however, is contingent on mass vaccinations. “The list of industries that have been hit hard by Covid-19 is long, with shipping being just one of the many casualties,” shipbroker Gibson said, as quoted by Hellenic Shipping News, earlier this week. “Although in spring tanker rates surged to unprecedented highs amid discharging delays and floating storage demand, today’s market is very different, with TCE earnings on many trades stuck at or below OPEX for a few months now. ” Related: OPEC+ Complied 101% With Oil Production Cuts In August Interestingly enough, demand for tankers for storing oil offshore is on the rise. In fact, Lloyd’s says demand for tankers for floating storage could be the single driver of demand for this industry in the next quarter. Unfortunately, this does not mean that freight rates would recover to the highs of the first half. On Monday, spot rates for Very Large Crude Carriers stood at $27,900 per day, American Shipper senior editor Greg Miller wrote. That’s a lot lower than the $68,000 in average freight rates for the first half of the year and yet it is a massive, 124-percent, improvement on Monday last week. Demand for floating storage is helping tanker owners reach breakeven. But it may take a while to get any better than this. Traders and producers stored as much as 1. 3 billion barrels of crude during the first five months of this year, both offshore and onshore, Energy Intelligence’s John van Schaik reported earlier this month. Those were good times for tankers. But then OPEC+ started cutting production and floating—and onshore—storage began draining, at a rate of 100 million barrels monthly. Recovery in oil demand following easing of lockdowns helped, however weak it was. But it hasn’t been enough. Even OPEC+’s easing of their production cuts did not help. Bloomberg wrote in July, the month before cuts were reduced by 2 million barrels daily, that the addition of 2 million bpd to world markets would have been good news any other year if it wasn’t preceded by production cuts of 9. 7 million bpd for three months before that. Demand for vessels for floating storage was also on the decline at the time, removing this source demand for tankers as well. And to add insult to injury, Russia and Saudi Arabia, the biggest producers in OPEC+, were keeping more of the additional oil they were producing for the domestic market, probably not least because of still unfavourable prices. Related: Oil Rises After EIA Confirms Crude Inventory Draw As if this was not enough bad news, there is more. Although growing demand for VLCCs for floating storage is on the rise, much of the oil that traders and producers stored in the spring is still there, FreightWaves’ Miller noted. Off the coast of China, according to Kpler data, there are some 67 million barrels in storage alone. This means that the new demand for offshore storage will by necessity be limited, setting a ceiling on freight rates, too. Brent crude is trading at just a little over $40 a barrel after last week it fell below this threshold on renewed concern about future demand. WTI is trading below $39 a barrel. There are more than 170 vaccine candidates in different stages of development around the world. Nine are in an advanced stage of testing. There are hopes we could have a working vaccine before the year’s end, although medical experts have been warning against too much optimism. Vaccines are the only thing that could save the tanker industry right now. If there is an effective vaccine and mass vaccinations, air travel will start to recover. If air travel starts to recover, so will overall oil demand. Yet it is worth noting that this will not happen overnight, even in the best-case scenario where a vaccine becomes widely available before the end of this year. Tanker owners are due more trouble before the situation returns to anything resembling the normal boom-and-bust cycle. By Irina Slav for Oilprice. com More Top Reads From Oilprice. com: "

    "body": "2020/09/17 - More on Covid-19 US drug developer Novavax Inc said on Tuesday it was doubling its potential Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity to two billion doses annually under an agreement with Serum Institute of India, sending its shares up about 7%. In August, Novavax signed a deal with Serum Institute, the world’s largest producer of vaccines, to produce a minimum of one billion doses of its vaccine candidate, when approved, for low- and middle-income countries and India. As part of the expanded agreement, Serum Institute will also manufacture the antigen component of the vaccine, dubbed NVX-CoV2373, which Novavax said will bring its manufacturing capacity to over two billion doses by mid-2021. Novavax’s vaccine is currently in mid-stage trials after an early-stage study showed it produced high levels of antibodies against the novel coronavirus . The company plans to begin late-stage trials in the third quarter. Last month, Novavax said it will supply 60 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine candidate to the UK beginning as early as the first quarter of 2021. The company is also preparing to deliver 100 million doses to the United States by January after it was awarded $1. 6 billion for its potential vaccine, and has also signed supply agreements with Canada and Japan. Other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc have already begun large late-stage studies of their experimental vaccines. "

Though yes, alcohol may temporarily relieve some stress, it should not become a habit. Alcohol is actually a depressant that can increase anxiety. Choose herbal tea over alcohol. It has been observed that tea drinkers have a lower level of cortisol, the stress hormone. Herbal teas are caffeine-free. Caffeine can trigger anxiety and interfere with sleep. So, a cup of herbal tea might not look as great as a glass of wine but it surely will make you feel better if you are stressed. "

Also Read - Wait, What? Handgrip Can Detect People at High Diabetes Risk? The study, published in the journal Diabetologia, indicates that prolonged loneliness may influence the development of diabetes, suggesting the experience of lockdown could potentially compound people’s vulnerability in this pandemic if the loneliness continues for some time. Also Read - Are You Suffering From Diabetes?

Also Read - Antibiotics May up Heart Disease Risk in People With Diabetes The research team analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study Ageing on 4,112 adults aged 50 years and over which was collected at several times from 2002 to 2017. At the start of data collection all participants were free of diabetes and had normal levels of blood glucose. The study showed that over a period of 12 years 264 people developed type 2 diabetes. and the level of loneliness measured at the start of data collection was a significant predictor of the onset of type 2 diabetes later on in life. This relationship remained intact when accounting for smoking, alcohol, weight, level of blood glucose, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. The association was also independent of depression, living alone and social isolation. The study also demonstrated a clear distinction between loneliness and social isolation in that isolation or living alone does not predict type 2 diabetes whereas loneliness, which is defined by a person’s quality of relationships, does. According to the team, a possible biological reason behind the association between loneliness and type 2 diabetes could be the impact of constant loneliness on the biological system responsible for stress, which, over time affects the body and increases the risk for diabetes. “If the feeling of loneliness becomes chronic, then everyday you’re stimulating the stress system and over time that leads to wear and tear on your body and those negative changes in stress-related biology may be linked to type 2 diabetes development,” Hackett explained.

S. investigation into a serious side effect in Britain even as other trials of the vaccine resume, sources familiar with the details told Reuters. AstraZeneca on Saturday said it had restarted its trial in Britain after regulators completed their review of a serious side effect in one trial participant there. This was the first indication that the U. S. trial will remain on hold until the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and a safety panel investigate the case. Enrollment in the company’s global trials of the vaccine, which it is developing with researchers at Oxford University, was put on pause on September 6. Sources told Reuters that enrollment of new patients and other trial procedures for the pivotal U. S. trial were being rescheduled until at least midweek and that it was not clear how long it would take for the FDA to complete its probe. Governments around the world are desperate for a vaccine to help end the pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil. The World Health Organization (WHO) had flagged AstraZeneca’s as the most promising. A prolonged delay in the U. S. trial could slow access to the vaccine in the United States. The British adverse event involved a study patient thought to be suffering a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman declined to comment on when the U. S. trial would resume. She said in an email the company “will continue to work with health authorities across the world, including the FDA, and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume. ” The status of the South African and Indian trials remains unknown, but the trial in Brazil has also restarted. The company has not commented on timing of resumption in other parts of the world besides Britain. FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

    "title": "EPF withdrawal soared to 39 400 cr during lockdown govt",
    "body": "2020/09/15 - Salaried employees withdrew a massive ₹39,400 crore from Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) accounts between 25 March and 31 August as covid-19 impacted lives and livelihood of millions of workers, the Union labour ministry informed the Lok Sabha on Monday. Of the total 10. 4 million salaried workers who dipped into their retirement savings in this period, at least 8. 2 million are those who earn a salary of less than ₹15,000 per month each, reflective of the hardship the bottom of the pyramid faced during the lockdown imposed to check the spread of covid-19 and the ensuing income and job loss. Since the beginning of the lockdown on 25 March till end of August, ₹39,403 crore had been withdrawn, the labour ministry said. Of this, more than 40% is from the three industrial states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, it said. EPF subscribers in Maharashtra withdrew ₹7,837. 85 crore, while in Karnataka the figure was ₹5,743. 96 crore and in Tamil Nadu, including Puducherry, the amount of withdrawal was ₹4,984. 51 crore. Delhi and Telangana are the other two states where the withdrawal by EPF subscribers was collectively more than ₹5,500 crore. The withdrawal of more than ₹39,400 core is almost 30% of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization’s (EPFO) annual accruals and may have a long-term impact on the financial health of the retirement fund body. The labour ministry did not give any details about reasons for the withdrawals but EPFO data showed that a majority of the withdrawal numbers are related to covid-19 advances. EPFO had earlier this month said that 55% of advance claims settled during April-August 2020 were related to the recently introduced covid-19 advance, while 31% of advances settled during the period pertained to illness claims. “With EPFO settling advance claims within three days, PF accumulations are now seen as liquid assets that can timely meet the need of the subscribers during crisis. Consequently, members have shown greater trust in EPFO by not opting for final withdrawal or closure of account, instead choosing to apply for PF advances to meet their financial needs,” the EPFO had said earlier this month. According to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, salaried jobs were down from 86 million in FY20 to 65 million in August, underlining the 21 million job losses that the country faced due to the pandemic. In response to a separate question on the number of migrant deaths during lockdown, the Union labour ministry said there is no such data is available, but added that the central government had issued comprehensive advisory guidelines on 27 July to all the states and Union territories for the welfare of workers returning to their destination states against the backdrop of covid-19.

    "body": "2020/09/15 - Spain’s first trials of a coronavirus vaccine are scheduled to begin on Monday, Alberto Borobia, the chief of the clinical trials unit of the La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, said on Sunday. The vaccine to be tested was developed by US corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson. Phase 1 trials were held in the United States and Belgium. The trials in Spain will fall under Phase 2, to be also held in Germany and Belgium. Three Spanish hospitals will be administering the trials – the Marques de Valdecilla hospital in Santander will launch then on Monday and the La Paz and La Princesa university hospitals in Madrid will join in on Tuesday, according to Borobia. The expected pool of participants includes 190 volunteers, of which La Paz University Hospital’s share will be 50 adults aged 18-55 and 25 seniors aged over 65, Borobia told Spanish news agency Servimedia. The participants will get either one shot of the vaccine or two shots a month apart. There will also be a group that will be given a placebo. Doctors will monitor the participants throughout the entire period of trials. “If everything goes well,” Borobia said, the first wave of vaccination will end on September 22. While the final results on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness are expected no sooner than in 16 months, Borobia said the transition to Phase 3 clinical trials was permissible upon satisfactory preliminary results. The epidemiological situation in Spain, which used to be Europe’s second-worst outbreak at the beginning of the year, worsened again in July. More than 560,000 cases were confirmed by Spanish health authorities, as of Sunday. Over the past week alone, 53,000 new cases were detected and 241 people died from the coronavirus. According to WHO protocols, a candidate vaccine has to complete three phases of clinical trials to be approved for industrial production. Phase 1 normally involves small-scale studies on up to 100 participants to determine a candidate vaccine’s safety and clinical tolerance. Phase 2 can include up to 1,000 and is more representative in terms of their age, ethnicity, and other statistically significant factors. This phase pursues to determine the optimal dose, intervals between doses, and the minimum necessary number of doses in a target population. Phase 3 trials are the largest and can include up to 10,000 participants with the maximum representation of target population categories. A candidate vaccine is ready to move into industrial production if this last phase provides clear and definitive evidence of its safety and efficacy. (ANI/Sputnik) "

    "body": "2020/09/15 - (Eds: Disclaimer: The following press release comes to you under an arrangement with PR Newswire. PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same. ) First air purification solution to test COVID-19, achieving a 99. 4% reduction of the surface strain within 30 minutes BENGALURU, India, Sept. 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ – Global Plasma Solutions (GPS), the leader in Indoor Air Quality, has announced industry-leading ionization testing results, demonstrating a 99. 4% reduction rate on a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) surface strain within 30 minutes, the first instance in which an air purification company has effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Following initial testing of coronavirus 229E in March 2020, Global Plasma Solutions utilized its proprietary needlepoint needlepoints bipolar ionization to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The study was jointly executed with Aviation Clean Air. GPS’ NPBI technology works to safely clean the air inside commercial as well as residential buildings. Speaking about the technology, Mr. Boban Varghese, MD Aircare Engineering shared, “Our proven technology delivers clean indoor air that is safe and healthy - producing neither ozone nor other harmful by-products. Through NPBI, our products purify the air by eliminating airborne particulates, odors and pathogens- most relevant in today’s Post Covid scenario. The combined effect is a lowered carbon footprint for your facility and up to 30% energy savings through a reduced (up to 75%) outdoor air intake. ” In the laboratory, a test was conducted to mimic ionization conditions like that of a commercial aircraft’s fuselage. Based on viral titrations, it was determined that at 10 minutes, 84. 2% of the virus was inactivated. At 15 minutes, 92. 6% of the virus was inactivated, and at 30 minutes, 99. 4% of the virus was inactivated. “For any kind of facility from hospitals, offices, commercial buildings to aircrafts, delivering the cleanest, safest indoor air environment will only become increasingly more important, and our ozone-free technology is one of the most sophisticated products on the market,” added Mr. Boban Varghese - Aircare Engineering. Understanding Needlepoint Bipolar ionization Needlepoint bipolar ionization works to safely clean indoor air, leveraging an electronic charge to create a high concentration of positive and negative ions. These ions travel through the air continuously seeking out and attaching to particles. This sets in motion a continuous pattern of particle combination. As these particles become larger, they are eliminated from the air more rapidly. Additionally, positive and negative ions have microbicidal effects on pathogens, ultimately reducing the infectivity of the virus. GPS’ needlepoint bipolar ionization is ozone-free and the only kind in its category to pass the RCTA DO-160 standard for aircraft. Traditional bipolar ionization systems produce harmful ozone as a byproduct.

    "body": "2020/09/15 - Mumbai, September 15 Researchers in the United Kingdom are all set to begin trials for the inhaled version of the coronavirus vaccine that is currently under development. The researchers believe that vaccine shots will work better if they reach the lungs directly, BBC reported. The trials will be conducted by the Imperial College, London. The researchers will try Oxford’s vaccine that is currently under temporary suspension and the vaccine developed by Imperial College which entered the human testing phase in June this year. The researchers said that they will take around 30 volunteers for the trials and the vaccine shot will be given in the form of a mist or aerosol. Lead researcher Dr. Chris Chiu was cited as saying in the BBC report: “The current pandemic is caused by a respiratory virus which primarily infects people through the cells lining the nose, throat, and lungs. These surfaces are specialised and produce a different immune response to the rest of the body. ” He added: “So it is critical we explore whether targeting the airways directly can provide an effective response compared to a vaccine injected into the muscle. ” Prof Robin Shattock, research lead on the Imperial vaccine, said: “A number of groups around the world are currently working on clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines. ” “And these will tell us whether these candidates can produce a systemic immune response against the virus. It may well be that one group has the right vaccine but the wrong delivery method. And only trials such as this will be able to tell us that,” he added. Many countries are vying for the coronavirus vaccine. There are as many as 180 vaccine candidates that are being explored and experimented globally. However, no vaccine has successfully completed all the trials yet, say media reports. Meanwhile, in a recent a poll conducted by the British Medical Association, around 86 per cent of doctors in England stated that they expect the second peak of coronavirus pandemic in the next six months.

    "body": "2020/09/15 - Various countries, including India, are lifting restrictions on travel and gatherings bit by bit. After the opening up of malls, gyms and the metro, the government of India has now allowed the opening up of bars and pubs. But looking at the rate at which the COVID-19 infection is still spreading, is it safe to visit such places? A study, published in the September issue of Morbid and Mortality Weekly Report by the US’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stated that going to the locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options can increase the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 infection. Determining the ability of COVID-19 transmission after unlock In order to assess the amount of exposure seen in the community or in people who must have come in contact with COVID-19 patients, scientists studied 364 patients at or above the age of 18 years with symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Of these patients, 154 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus which was confirmed by RT-PCR testing. Another 160 participants were kept in the control group as they had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. The scientists observed and asked about the activity of all these patients before they got the results of their test. The results of the study showed that around 42 percent of the case-patients (COVID-19 positive) had close contact with a person whereas only 14 percent of the control-participants (COVID-19 negative) were in contact with people. Close contact refers to coming within six feet of another person for 15 minutes or more. The case-patients also stated that they went for dining in restaurants and went to a bar or coffee shop two weeks before the onset of the disease. This indicated that they might have come in contact with infected people in these settings where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain. Restaurants and bars can become hotspots The basic risk involved is obvious - one cannot wear a mask while eating and drinking, whereas masks can be effectively worn while doing other activities such as shopping or even visiting your workplace. Furthermore, the spread of infection in bars and restaurants is also associated with the circulation of air. As most of these places have centralised air-conditioning, the ventilation and intensity of airflow may influence the transmission of COVID-19 infection even when social distancing is practised and masks are worn. What can be done to prevent the spread of the disease? Since practising social distancing and wearing masks can be difficult in restaurants and bars, one must avoid places that offer on-site eating and drinking to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather than sitting and eating right there, you can get your food packed and take it to your house. In case you still wish to visit such places, take care of the following things:    Call the restaurant or bar and ask them about the practices they are following to reduce exposure of the customers and employees to the disease.     Ask about the maximum number of people that are being seated in the bar/restaurant at a time or when it is the least crowded.     See if the sanitation and hygiene measures are being undertaken properly.     If possible, ask for outdoor seating so there is better ventilation.     Instead of using cash, opt for an online banking portal to pay your bill.  For more information, read our article on Can asymptomatic patients spread COVID-19?

According to the review research, published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, when a significant section of the population becomes immune to the novel coronavirus and achieves herd immunity, the effective transmission of the virus may drop substantially making it more prone to seasonal fluctuations. “COVID-19 is here to stay and it will continue to cause outbreaks year-round until herd immunity is achieved,” warned study senior author Hassan Zaraket from the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. “Therefore, the public will need to learn to live with it, and continue practising the best prevention measures, including wearing of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and avoidance of gatherings,” Mr. Zaraket added. According to the scientists, there could be multiple waves of COVID-19 before herd immunity is achieved. Citing earlier research, they said other respiratory viruses similar to the novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - follow seasonal patterns, especially in temperate regions. They said influenza and several types of coronaviruses that cause common cold are known to peak in winter in temperate regions but circulate year-round in tropical regions. - PTI       10. 15 am   New Delhi   India’s tally nears grim 50-lakh mark India’s novel coronavirus tally crossed 49 lakh on Tuesday with 83,809 new cases, while 38. 59 lakh people have recuperated so far, taking the recovery rate to 78. 28 per cent, the Health Ministry said.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - In a new case of SIM card swapping fraud, scammers reportedly duped a Pune-based chartered accountant of Rs 2. 2 lakh from her bank account. The phishing fraud is said to have happened on May 28, when the victim, whose name was not revealed in the report, received a call from scammers that pretended to be engaged with her telecom operator. During the conversation, they seemingly convinced her that she was still using a 3G SIM card, which required urgent upgrade to 4G or risked being blocked immediately. A report by ET Telecom states that after receiving the call, the 39-year-old was duped into believing that the callers were legitimate. The scammers made the victim reveal certain key details about her phone number, following which they reportedly sent a 20-digit code to her phone number and asked her to click on it. Soon after this, the victim’s original SIM card was automatically deactivated, and the scammers took control of her number on a cloned SIM card that they now possessed, with her number registered on it. They then used it to siphon off funds worth Rs 2. 2 lakh from her account. The report reveals that the victim then received alerts of transactions being made from her bank account, following which she alerted her bank and blocked access to her account – but not before facing a significant loss already. An FIR on the matter was then lodged with the police department at Pune’s Alankar Police Station. According to the report, the police are still investigating the case of fraud, and the clear suspicion behind this scam is one of SIM card swapping fraud. SIM swapping frauds are among the most common form of phishing frauds that occur on a regular basis. To stay safe from such incidents, users are requested to not share any sensitive details over phone, unless they specifically opt for phone banking services via authorised contact hotlines of banks. It is always advised that users remain constantly vigilant about sharing any form of technical details about their particulars, and any SIM upgrade activities should only be performed by a user in person by visiting the stores of their telecom operators.

Trump claims that TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage. “ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,” the US tech giant said in a statement referring to TikTok’s owner. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement added. Following Trump’s executive order, Microsoft and Oracle were possible suitors to take over TikTok operations. Microsoft said that it would have “made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation. ” The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported that Oracle had won the bidding war, citing people familiar with the deal, although the company did not immediately confirm the matter to AFP. The Oracle bid would next need approval from the White House and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a source told the Journal, with both parties under the belief it would meet US data security concerns. TikTok has filed a lawsuit challenging the crackdown by the US government, contending that Trump’s order was a misuse of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform is not “an unusual and extraordinary threat. ” Downloaded 175 million times in the US, TikTok is used by as many as a billion people worldwide to make quirky, short-form videos on their cellphones. It has repeatedly denied sharing data with Beijing. "

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Leading hospitals in India including Tata Memorial, Apollo Hospitals, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Manipal Hospitals are turning to robots to clear the backlog of elective surgeries that had to be put on hold after the covid-19 outbreak to reduce the risk of exposure to patients and doctors. Though RAS (robotic assisted surgeries) has been around for many years, the usage has been sporadic. Post covid-19, the fear of crowded spaces and higher risk of infection due to prolonged stays in hospitals is making patients seek out robotic surgeries as an alternative to traditional open surgeries. “After the pandemic, we have been seeing an increase in demand for robotic surgery as the procedure allows for social distancing with lesser people around the patient and robot. The infection rates are lower as compared to laparoscopy and open surgeries,” said Amol Kumar Patil, consultant, Robotic Surgery &amp; Urology, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai. In March, the ministry of health and family welfare issued an advisory, urging hospitals across the country to put all non-essential elective surgeries on hold. This led to a backlog of surgeries. CovidSurg Collaborative, an international research consortium, has estimated that 5,05,800 elective surgeries including 51,100 cancer surgeries and 27,700 obstetric surgeries were delayed or cancelled in India due to the imposition of lockdown and fear of infection. “There is a sense of fear among patients to get treatment at hospitals. They are resisting treatment that involves any physical contact with surgeons and that requires longer hospital stays after surgery,” said Avanish Saklani, professor robotic/colorectal MS, FRCS, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. Traditional surgeries involve a large team of doctors that have to operate for long hours and use hundreds instruments for the completion of one surgery. “Due to the invasive cutting of the wound and excessive bleeding, the patient might develop post-surgery infections leading to higher risk of contracting the virus,” said Somashekhar S P, chairman &amp; HOD Surgical Oncology, MHEPL. Somashekhar explains, to avoid further backlog of surgeries, SAGE and Associations of Robotic consortium discussed new methods of conducting surgeries in the new covid-19 era. They compared traditional methods of surgery to robotic-assisted surgery and found that robotics had several benefits that were proving to be beneficial during covid-19. For instance, RAS involves just 4 instruments and a very small team of medical professionals in the operating room. The procedure is also less painful and causes less blood loss as the wound is just few millimetres in the subcuticular. Patients recover faster from the surgery, leading to early discharge. Somasekar points out, robotic surgeries are also more convenient for doctors and allows them to perform many surgeries in a single day without feeling fatigued. The surgeries are performed by robotic arms are controlled by a doctor sitting at a remote console with access to 12 times magnified 3D view of the surgery. “During the initial days of the lockdown, people were avoiding surgeries, but now it is picking pace. As of now, 60% of the surgeries we are doing is through robotics,” said Sudhir Kumar Rawal, director – Surgical Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Charlie Russell, 27, is one of an estimated 600,000 people with post-Covid illness, a condition that may give an insight into ME It’s day 182 after being infected by Covid-19, and Charlie Russell is not doing the things that other 27-year-olds are doing. He’s not running 5km three times a week like he used to. He’s not going to the pub. He’s not working. And he’s not getting better. “If I had known that I’d be this ill, I would have taken everything a lot more seriously back in March,” Russell said. “But all that we heard back then was that if you were infected and you were a young person, you’d most likely not have any symptoms at all. Or you’d be ill for a couple of weeks and that would be it. ” Instead, Russell has suffered from chest pains, excruciating migraines, severe breathlessness, dizziness and exhaustion, one of the legions of “long Covid” sufferers who have experienced long-term symptoms from the coronavirus. Record numbers of people in their 20s are testing positive for covid-19, according to the latest figures from Public Health England, which showed 3,366 had the virus in the first week of September. That is higher than the 3,325 cases at the end of April, although those tests were mostly conducted on people in hospitals. Although people under 40 face a much lower risk of dying from the illness, 20-somethings like Russell are catching covid-19 in far higher numbers than other age groups: 20- to 29-year-olds make up nearly 28% of all new infections. Few will need hospital treatment, but long-Covid support groups and medical experts fear that a significant minority will end up with a severely debilitating condition that scientists do not yet understand. “We’ve got this terrific emphasis at the moment on the idea that younger people will be OK and the main reason they shouldn’t go out is because they might infect their grannies,” said Charles Shepherd, medical adviser to the ME Association which supports people with myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome. The association has seen substantial numbers of long-Covid patients turning to it for support. “There is a risk that if younger people catch the disease, they may not end up in hospital but they could have an illness that leaves them exhausted with post-Covid syndrome. It’s not going to happen to the majority, but there is a real risk for a significant minority,” Shepherd said. About 600,000 people have some sort of post-Covid illness, according to Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, who says that around 12% of sufferers report symptoms to the Covid Tracker app for longer than 30 days. One in 200 says the effects last for more than 90 days. Russell, who is a photographer specialising in theatre, has not worked since he fell ill. He is precise about the date: 14 March. “I’ve had plenty of time to look back and think, what was I doing then? And how I wished I hadn’t been doing that. ” His illness lasted two weeks and he felt better not long afterwards, then experienced terrifying chest pains “like someone was sitting on me”. But hospital doctors and his GP said tests showed there were no problems – a common experience of long-Covid patients, according to Frances Simpson, a founder of the support group Long Covid SOS, who says many struggle to have their symptoms taken seriously by the medical profession. Russell was luckier than most – he changed GP, and the new doctor ordered an antibody test which confirmed he had had the virus. He is now one of 500 patients taking part in the Coverscan clinical trial into the impact of Covid-19. “When people refuse to wear masks or to even obey the most basic of social distance rules, it’s very, very frustrating,” Russell said. “I just want to shake them and say ‘I’ve been living with this for six months’. “I think a lot of young people – and it’s human nature – think that if something doesn’t affect you directly, it almost doesn’t exist. Friends of mine who are still going out to the pubs, still going out to dinners and not really taking it that seriously. I do worry for them. ” Russell was in good condition before the virus hit, with his regular 5km runs timed at about 23 minutes. Now he struggles to climb stairs. Long Covid SOS and other groups say that their members receive little help and there is little recognition of the condition. They want the government to formally recognise the long -term impact of the virus, provide financial support for those unable to work because of long Covid and establish multidisciplinary clinics to help assess and treat patients. Research has only recently begun into the long-term effects of Covid-19, but Shepherd said the working theory was that the coronavirus had disrupted people’s immune systems, causing a cytokine storm, or an overreaction of the body’s protective system, which is thought to also be a factor in ME and chronic fatigue syndrome. “Several studies in the last two or three years show that immune system dysfunction is probably involved in ME,” he said. The immune system seems to continue to activate on a low level, trying to fight off a virus that is no longer there. That reaction may then affect the central nervous system and the hypothalamus. If post-Covid fatigue and ME are linked, research may provide solutions to both conditions. It has been difficult to study ME since most people with the condition have lived with it for months – if a virus was involved, it has left little trace by the time researchers meet their patient. “This is the first time you can follow people almost from day one. Researchers are building large cohorts, they have got blood samples, and they can follow patients almost from the point of infection to when they develop post-viral fatigue. We’ve never had the opportunity to do that before. ” "

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Experts from California university said face masks may provide a vaccine-like effect by generating immunity and slowing the spread of Covid-19 infection. Scientists are comparing face masks to a process called variolation wherein healthy people are exposed to material from the scabs of infected patients in order to increase immunity. Variolation was followed before a vaccine for smallpox was discovered. In a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine, Monica Gandhi and George W Rutherford of University of California in San Francisco said using masks in the Covid era could achieve similar results. Gandhi and Rutherford concluded that face masks could reduce the viral inoculum (infecting amount of the virus). This they inferred based on long-standing theory that the severity of the disease is proportionate to the viral inoculum. (Photo: AFP) “Since masks filter out some virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined by mask type), masking might reduce the inoculum that an exposed person inhales,” the pair wrote in the journal. Moreover, an experiment conducted on hamsters supported this theory and showed with simulated masking the animals were less likely to get infected, or were either asymptomatic or had milder symptoms than unmasked hamsters. “Universal masking seems to reduce the rate of new infections; we hypothesise that by reducing the rate of new viral infections, it would also decrease the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic,” Gandhi and Rutherford wrote. The duo also referred to an outbreak on a closed Argentinian cruise ship where passengers were provided with surgical masks and staff with N95 masks. The rate of asymptomatic infection was 81 per cent on testing compared with 20 per cent in earlier cruise ship outbreaks without universal masking. Dr S K Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said this paper explained how 29 per cent of Delhi were antibody-positive but have never had infection. “Mask may allow a very miniscule amount of virus to enter and provide a vaccine-like effect, leading to antibody formation without true infection,” said Sarin. – Agencies "

Data storage capacity in each sector is 512 bytes. Data are organized cylinder-wise and the addressing format is  Explain  First convert ⟨1200,9,40⟩ into sector address.  (1200×16×64)+(9×64)+40=1229416 Number of sectors to store file =(42797 KB)/512=85594 Last sector to store file =1229416+85594=1315010 Now, do reverse engineering, 1315010/(16×64)=1284. 189453 (1284 will be cylinder number and remaining sectors =194) 194/64=3. 03125 (3 is surface number and remaining sectors are 2) ∴⟨1284,3,1⟩ is last sector address. Concept  A file system with 300 GByte disk uses a file descriptor with 8 direct block addresses, 1 indirect block address and 1 doubly indirect block address. The size of each disk block is 128 Bytes and the size of each disk block address is 8 Bytes. The maximum possible file size in this file system is?  Expain:  The question in simple words- A 300GB disk has indexing in which 8 direct block addresses are present, 1 single indirect block(means it points to the address of a disk block in which 128/8=16 more addresses are stored which further stores data ), and 1 doubly indirect address is present. so using this file decryptor what is the max. possible size of a file possible that can be supported by this file system.  Direct block addressing will point to 8 disk blocks =8×128 B=1 KB Singly Indirect block addressing will point to 1 disk block which has 128/8 disc block addresses =(128/8)×128 B=2 KB Doubly indirect block addressing will point to 1 disk block which has 128/8 addresses to disk blocks which in turn has 128/8 addresses to disk blocks =16×16×128 B=32 KB Total =35 KB  An application loads 100 libraries at startup. Loading each library requires exactly one disk access. The seek time of the disk to a random location is given as 10 ms. Rotational speed of disk is 6000 rpm. If all 100 libraries are loaded from random locations on the disk, how long does it take to load all libraries? (The time to transfer data from the disk block once the head has been positioned at the start of the block may be neglected. ) average rotation latency = (1/2)× rotation time Disk access time=Seektime+Rotational latency+Transfer time (given that transfer time isneglected) ##### explain:Seek time=10 msRotational speed=6000 rpm    60s→6000 rotations     1 rotation→60/6000s     Rotational latency=1/2×60/6000s=5 ms  Total time to transfer one library =10+5=15 ms ∴ Total time to transfer 100 libraries =100×15 ms=1. 5s  The data blocks of a very large file in the Unix file system are allocated using?

An ISR is invoked on completion of I/O in synchronous I/O but not in asynchronous I/OB. In both synchronous and asynchronous I/O, an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) is invoked after completion of the I/OC. A process making a synchronous I/O call waits until I/O is complete, but a process making an asynchronous I/O call does not wait for completion of the I/OD. In the case of synchronous I/O, the process waiting for the completion of I/O is woken up by the ISR that is invoked after the completion of I/OB is false. "

Which of the following must be true of multi-programmed systems in order that a single copy of a program can be shared by several users? I. The program is a macro II. The program is recursive III. The program is reentran. #####Question 34 Explanation:Reentrant code is commonly required in operating systems and in applications intended to be shared in multi-use systems. A programmer writes a reentrant program by making sure that no instructions modify the contents of variable values in other instructions within the program. Each time the program is entered for a user, a data area is obtained which keep all the variable values for that user. The data area is in another part of memory from the program itself. When the program is interrupted to give another user a turn to use the program, information about the data area associated with that user is saved. When the interrupted user of the program is once again given control of the program, information in the saved data area is recovered and the program can be reentered without concern that the previous user has changed some instruction within the program. The program is recursive is correct.  Which of the following comment about peep-hole optimization is true?It is applied to small part of the code and applied repeatedly,Peep-hole optimization is a type of optimization technique which is applied to small part of the code called as ‘peep’ and Peephole optimization involves the changing in small set of instructions to an equivalent set of instruction that gives the better performance compare to other optimization technique and applied repeatedly.  Consider the code segment  int i, j, x, y, m, n; n=20; for (i = 0, i &lt; n; i++){ for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)  {   if (i % 2)   {    x + = ((4*j) + 5*i);    y += (7 + 4*j);   }  }}m = x + y;       The code contains loop invariant computation    There is scope of common sub-expression elimination in this code There is scope of strength reduction in this code There is scope of dead code elimination in this code  Answer:  There is scope of dead code elimination in this code. in dead code elimination technique it removes the dead code as name suggested. The statements of code is called dead code in which code is either never executes or unreachable or their output is never used are eliminated but here is not such type of statements or code. Here we reduce the strength reduction as replacing the “ 4 * j with 4 « j “ and code has common sub-expression as well as loop invariant computations.   Peephole optimization is form of Local optimization.   Answer:  ```In the optimisation technique, we optimise the code during compilation which reduces the space complexity as well as time complexity and eliminate the redundant code. Peephole optimization one of the optimisation technique which performed on a small set of compiler-generated instructions and the small set is known as the peephole or window. Peephole optimization does change the small set of instructions to the other an equivalent set which has better performance. :- For example :-   Peephole optimization technique would remove both instructions push and pop operation on stack instead of pushing register A onto the stack and then immediately popping the value back into register A Peephole optimization technique might do an arithmetic shift left Instead of adding A to A.  Peephole optimization technique might scale the floating point register’s exponent by 3 Instead of multiplying a floating point register by 8. The main objective of peephole optimization is:  To improve performance To reduce memory footprint To reduce code size``` In compiler terminology reduction in strength means  replacing a costly operation by a relatively cheaper one. :   The use of multiple register windows with overlap causes a reduction in the number of memory accesses for I. Function locals and parameters II. Register saves and restores III. Instruction fetches  needed study:   The expression (a*b)* c op……. . where ‘op’ is one of ‘+’, ‘***’ and ‘↑**’ (exponentiation) can be evaluated on a CPU with a single register without storing the value of (a * b) if  Given expression is :-:  (ab) c op Here op is one of the ‘+’, ‘’ and ‘↑’ (exponentiation). (a b)* having high precedence so it will evaluate first in CPU register. But we have given one single register as we cannot store any value from reg to memory. Now ( a * b ) is evaluated in register R and precedence order is ( ↑ , * or / , + or – ). If we put op as (ab) c op ‘ ↑ ‘ then expression becomes as (ab) c ↑ d here c ↑ d will evaluate first. But we have not extra register to evaluate ( a * b ). Therefore we cannot put any operator having precedence greater than ” * ”. Hence, Operator is either ” + ” or “- ” .

Condition field have four status, it needs 2 bits for four different condition. Branch field have four option so,it needs 2 bits for four option. Now there are 128 different memory location, So, there 7 bits atre required for 128 diffeent location. Instruction Field: q8 (1) Total bits are 20. So, option (B) is correct. Main components of memory tube display are: Flood gunPrimary gunWriting BeamCollectorStorage gridScreenFocussing &amp; deflection systemFlood electronGround or baseOnly Liquid crystal is not enlisted here and it is not the display component in memory tube A 32 - bit wide main memory unit with a capacity of 1 GB is built using 256M X 4-bit DRAM chips. The number of rows of memory cells in the DRAM chip is 214. The time taken to perform one refresh operation is 50 nanoseconds. The refresh period is 2 milliseconds. The percentage (rounded to the closet integer) of the time available for performing the memory read/write operations in the main memory unit is ___Given, total number of rows is 214 and time taken to perform one refresh operation is 50 nanoseconds. So, total time taken to perform refresh operation = 214*50 nanoseconds = 819200 nanoseconds = 0. 819200 milliseconds. But refresh period is 2 milliseconds. So, time spent in refresh period in percentage = (0. 819200 milliseconds) / (2 milliseconds) = 0. 4096 = 40. 96% Hence, time spent in read/write operation = 100% - 40. 96% = 59. 04% = 59 (in percentage and rounded to the closet integer). So, answer is 59. ##### The RISC design philosophy generally incorporates a larger number of registers to prevent in large amounts of interactions with memory. The decision of RISC processor designers to provide simple addressing modes leads to uniform length instructions, so RISC instruction is of uniform fixed length. In the hardwired control unit, the control units use fixed logic circuits to interpret instructions and generate control signals from them. It is significantly faster than its counterpart but is rather inflexible. Most of the RISC processors are based on the hardwired control unit design approach. A processor has 16 integer registers (R0, R1, … , R15) and 64 floating point registers (F0, F1, … , F63). It uses a 2-byte instruction format. There are four categories of instructions: Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, and Type 4. Type-1 category consists of four instructions, each with 3 integer register operands (3Rs). Type-2 category consists of eight instructions, each with 2 floating point register operands (2Fs). Type-3 category consists of fourteen instructions, each with one integer register operand and one floating point register operand (1R+1F). Type-4 category consists of N instructions, each with a floating point register operand (1F). The maximum value of N is ___ .

Size of a pointer is fixed for a compiler. All pointer types take same number of bytes for a compiler. That is why we get 4 for both ptri and ptrc.     Guess Output   #include&lt;stdio. h&gt; int main() { int a; char *x; x = (char *) &amp;a; a = 512; x[0] = 1; x[1] = 2; printf( %dn ,a);  return 0; }    Ans. machine dependent   Explanation: Output is 513 in a little endian machine. To understand this output, let integers be stored using 16 bits. In a little endian machine, when we do x[0] = 1 and x[1] = 2, the number a is changed to 00000001 00000010 which is representation of 513 in a little endian machine.    Segmenation fault:: Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that “does not belong to you. ” It’s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory – accessing variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc. Segmentation fault is essentially the same in most languages that let you mess with the memory management, there is no principial difference between segfaults in C and C++. There are many ways to get a segfault, at least in the lower-level languages such as C(++). A common way to get a segfault is to dereference a null pointer: int *p = NULL;*p = 1;Another segfault happens when you try to write to a portion of memory that was marked as read-only: char *str =  Foo ; // Compiler marks the constant string as read-only*str = 'b'; // Which means this is illegal and results in a segfaultDangling pointer points to a thing that does not exist any more, like here: char *p = NULL;{  char c;  p = &amp;c;}// Now p is danglingThe pointer p dangles because it points to character variable c that ceased to exist after the block ended. And when you try to dereference dangling pointer (like *p=’A’), you would probably get a segfault.  void * type pointers cannot be de-referenced  #include&lt;stdio. h&gt;int main(){ int a = 12; void *ptr = (int *)&amp;a; printf( %d , *ptr); getchar(); return 0;}    Ans. Compiler Error   Increment the pointer or value?  int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int *p = arr; ++*p;    Explanation: The expression ++*p is evaluated as  ++(*p)  . So it increments the value of first element of array (doesn't change the pointer p). When p += 2 is done, p is changed to point to third element of array.    Time Complexity: "
